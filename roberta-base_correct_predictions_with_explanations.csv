"dear friends and family ,
on april 15 and 16 i will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on
the ms 150 which is a two day bike tour from houston to austin covering 182
miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis .
multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable . symptoms may be
mild such as numbness in the limbs , or severe paralysis or loss of vision .
most people with ms are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the
unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong
my wife , ilene was diagnosed with ms almost three years ago ; at first i was
at a loss of how i could support her . that was until i heard of the ms 150 ,
which is one of the greatest challenges of my life . it is my choice to
participate in the ms 150 , ilene does not have a choice , as she has to live
with ms every day .
this will be my third year riding in the ms 150 raising money for the
national ms society to fight multiple sclerosis . in 1998 my goal was simple .
it was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own . i succeeded in my
endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $ 6 , 000 . in 1999
i raised my goal to $ 10 , 000 and finished the tour . not only did i meet my
goal , but surpassed it by raising $ 15 , 000 to fight this devastating disease
with the help of my friends and family . this year my goal is even greater !
my wife and i are once again asking for your help . this year on the 2000 ms
150 bike tour , my goal is to raise $ 20 , 000 .
enron is a big supporter of the ms 150 . for the past two years we were the
largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally .
last year we raised $ 310 , 000 with 300 riders . enron will match dollar for
dollar on all contributions donated in my name . using this secure , fast and
easy web page you can make a tax - deductible donation ( if clicking on the link
below does not work you can cut and paste the link to your browser ) .
mail = jnorden % 40 enron % 2 ecom
if you would prefer to send a check it should be made out to the national ms
society and sent to the address below .
i appreciate your continued support of the ms society and the isuzu ms 150
bike tour . the funds raised on the isuzu ms 150 bike tour provides
equipment , financial assistance , self - help groups , counseling , information
and resources , as well as education for people with ms and their families .
your support truly makes a difference in the lives of people with multiple
sclerosis .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

enron ' s lay turns down severance pay

enron corp . said its chairman , kenneth lay , has decided to forgo a severance payment of $ 60 . 6 million that could be triggered by dynegy inc . ' s planned acquisition of enron . mr . lay ' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice .
early in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay ' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities .
but by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn ' t attend the traders ' meeting , senior managers told him that "" opinions were expressed that he shouldn ' t receive the payment , "" mr . palmer said . "" he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . "" the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day .
the initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . "" things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , "" mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director .
for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies .
separately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board "" failed in its responsibility "" to monitor the activities of enron executives .
mr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling ' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 .
under the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million .
mr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn ' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron ' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay ' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay .
mr . palmer said it is a "" cheap shot "" to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . "" the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , "" mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing "" the very best service possible . "" mark lay couldn ' t be reached for comment .
coming on top of disclosures of enron ' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron ' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships .
mark lay ' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and "" certain other individuals "" who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron ' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up "" a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , "" according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron ' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business .
as part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to "" convey "" to enron "" certain intangible property rights "" from ppmc .
mark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer .
since 1985 , sharon lay ' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm ' s revenue in some years . she said her brother ' s position was "" more a problem "" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn ' t worked hard enough to get enron ' s business .

enron ceo cut stakes in firms where he sits in director ' s seat

kenneth l . lay , enron corp . ' s embattled chairman and chief executive , in recent weeks has cashed in nearly $ 2 million of shares in companies at which he sits on the board .
mr . lay , 59 years , sold $ 1 . 2 million of shares , or more than a quarter of his holdings , of compaq computer corp . , where he has been a director for 14 years . in his first sale of the houston - based company ' s shares since 1999 , he disposed of 124 , 596 shares oct . 29 for $ 9 . 25 each , leaving him with a 340 , 724 share stake . apart from two directors who resigned , he is the only compaq insider to have sold shares this year .
the sale comes as the computer company awaits completion of its planned merger with hewlett - packard co . - - a deal the board has repeatedly said it supports . in a nov . 7 news release , the board , including mr . lay , said it "" reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger . "" a day earlier , h - p ' s founding hewlett family , which controls 5 % of h - p stock , said it intended to oppose the merger , throwing the deal ' s future into uncertainty . compaq shares traded at $ 8 . 80 , up $ 1 . 14 , as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday .
the sale , mr . lay said , wasn ' t related to his views on the merger . "" it ' s no negative [ reflection ] on compaq , "" he said . mr . lay , who also sold shares of drug maker eli lilly and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off - balance - sheet partnerships . shares have recovered some ground since friday ' s announcement by dynegy inc . , a rival houston independent power producer , of plans to acquire enron . shares of enron traded at $ 9 . 98 , up 74 cents , or 8 % , on the big board as of 4 p . m .
as previously reported , mr . lay sold $ 25 . 7 million of his enron shares this year , as the stock fell from about $ 78 to under $ 44 , and his remaining stake is valued at about $ 28 million . for 2000 , he earned a salary of $ 1 . 3 million , a bonus of $ 7 million , plus $ 7 . 5 million in enron restricted stock and other benefits , including use of a personal plane , according to enron ' s proxy statement .

enron chief will give up severance
by richard a . oppel jr . and floyd norris

c . 2001 new york times company
trying to quell a furious reaction from employees outraged that he stood to profit from a merger with dynegy inc . , kenneth l . lay , the chairman and chief executive of the enron corporation , decided late yesterday to give up a severance package worth more than $ 60 million .
the tumult at enron ' s headquarters in houston began after the company disclosed in a securities filing earlier in the day that mr . lay was in line to collect $ 60 . 6 million in pay after the deal closed next year , $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left in his employment contract .
mr . lay had been a popular leader as enron grew in the last 15 years from a pipeline operator into the nation ' s largest energy trader , a business largely of his invention . employees shared in the gains , though none gained as much as mr . lay , who has collected more than $ 300 million since 1989 , mostly through exercising stock options .
but the value of employees ' stock options and their 401 ( k ) accounts evaporated this fall as enron shares plummeted amid concerns over the company ' s accounting practices . and traders and other workers started the day yesterday gossiping angrily about mr . lay ' s severance package .
then , at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company ' s core natural gas and electricity trading operation , which provides by far the biggest part of enron ' s profits , ' ' quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change - of - control payment , ' ' mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said .
at about 4 p . m . central time , two senior executives who had attended the meeting , john lavorato and louise kitchen , told mr . lay about the reaction of employees . ' ' ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether , ' ' mr . palmer said . even if dynegy ' s directors later voted to award mr . lay a new severance agreement , he would turn it down , mr . palmer added .
' ' what ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts , that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control , ' ' mr . palmer said . ' ' this issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it . ' '
severance pay had been an awkward matter for mr . lay in the last week . the only reason that enron was being acquired - - putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect - - were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch . the company ' s shares have lost almost 90 percent of their value after peaking in the summer of 2000 .
during merger discussions last week , mr . lay told dynegy ' s chairman , charles l . watson , that he wanted to rework the severance package , mr . palmer said . on monday , mr . watson disclosed that mr . lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options .
by yesterday afternoon , enron officials were saying that mr . lay planned to take two - thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation . and , they said , he wanted to give half of that amount , or one - third of his total package , to establish a charitable foundation to benefit enron employees .
it was about an hour later that enron said mr . lay would give up the severance entirely .
mr . lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company , which will be called dynegy .
the deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at enron .
whether mr . lay ' s gesture will placate enron ' s traders , who are now deluging other energy - trading companies with resumes , remains to be seen . dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than enron , and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent , and value , from the combined company .
' ' so much of their top talent is going out the door , i don ' t know what dynegy gets , ' ' said a senior executive at another rival firm .
the stunning near - collapse of enron - - bankruptcy was only averted , some analysts say , by the dynegy acquisition - - closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business .
the ugly circumstances of enron ' s downfall , including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company ' s balance sheet and that enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost $ 600 million , have left mr . lay ' s reputation in tatters .
just months ago , mr . lay was widely hailed - - or decried , in some circles - - as the genius behind energy deregulation . his friend , george w . bush , had been elected president , and policies favored by enron were front and center in the administration ' s energy policy . mr . lay retired from day - to - day management , making plans to pursue new business interests .
but he again assumed the chief executive ' s post at enron in august , after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor , jeffrey k . skilling , and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed . on monday , mr . lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer , but he declined to say what those plans were .
even without the severance package , mr . lay has become enormously wealthy running enron .
all told , from 1989 through this year , mr . lay collected about $ 13 million in salary ( his exact salary for this year is not known ) and $ 26 . 8 million in cash bonuses . but those sums were dwarfed by the $ 266 . 7 million in profits that he received in selling stock .
the bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years : $ 13 . 1 million in 1998 , $ 43 . 9 million in 1999 , $ 123 . 4 million in 2000 and $ 20 . 7 million this year - - a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through july 31 , and then stopped , not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining .
the options he has cashed in recent years , as well as those he now owns , are badly out of the money at enron ' s current stock price of $ 9 . 98 , down from a peak reached in 2000 of $ 90 . 75 .
his bonus in 2000 was $ 7 million , an award that enron ' s board said was based on the company ' s rising profits and high shareholder return . the company restated those profits last week , explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules . it said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was then enron ' s chief financial officer .
the company ' s stock price , which was in free fall after questions about the fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the securities and exchange commission , fell to $ 7 a share in the wake of the disclosures . that was the lowest price for the stock since 1991 . it rebounded to nearly $ 10 after dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap .
in january , enron ' s board awarded another bonus to mr . lay , of $ 3 . 6 million . that was based entirely on the company ' s shareholder return from 1997 through 2000 , which came to 294 percent , the company said . all of that return has since been wiped out .
also in january , mr . lay was awarded 106 , 578 shares of restricted stock , to vest periodically through 2004 . all the shares will now vest when the dynegy deal is completed , and while their value has plunged , the award is still worth more than $ 1 million .
still , mr . lay suffered huge paper losses this year .
at the end of 2000 , he had 5 . 1 million options that could have been exercised for profits of $ 257 . 5 million , and another 1 . 5 million options that would have been worth another $ 104 . 1 million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised - - assuming the share price stayed level . he exercised 565 , 928 of those options this year , making a profit of $ 20 . 7 million , but the ones he did not exercise are now under water .

companies & finance the americas - regulators face new boundaries in enron deal .

regulators wading into the competitive landscape following dynegy ' s offer to buy enron will be scrutinising a new industry where traditional yardsticks like market definition and barriers to entry have yet to be determined . this will make gaining approval of the $ 10 bn deal an uncertain and complicated task , experts said .
dynegy and enron have insisted the merger , which will combine the largest energy trading company in the world with one of its largest competitors , will be approved by federal regulators without significant conditions or divestitures .
but competition lawyers said this week that because the market for energy trading is so new - indeed , it was all but created by enron in the 1990 s - that federal agencies will have to spend months finding out how rivals compete in order to develop guidelines to measure the merger ' s impact .
"" we don ' t have any track record here , "" said ernest gellhorn , an antitrust expert at george mason university .
the deal will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , but the most critical approvals will come from the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) and us antitrust agencies .
central to the antitrust review will be how competition authorities define the market - how big it is , which companies are included as competitors , and how the market share is divided up .
former antitrust officials said enron might be forced to resort to a "" failing firm "" defence , which is occasionally used by companies with large market shares when attempting to add to their dominant position .
but robert mctamaney , an antitrust partner at carter ledyard & milburn , said the failing - firm route may be difficult for dynegy and enron to prove , since it requires a showing that without the merger , enron ' s trading business would exit the market completely .
helping the companies , however , is the relative ease with which competitors can enter the trading market , experts said .
an analysis of barriers will hinge on whether rivals can successfully argue that the level of expertise in the industry is so sophisticated - or that enron ' s trading technologies are so specialised - that it would be impossible for new entrants to duplicate the company ' s operations .
dynegy executives said they expect more scrutiny from ferc , though it rarely rejects mergers , and its guidelines put an emphasis on speed of reviews .

ken lay , the chairman and chief executive of enron , is set to turn down a dollars 60 . 6 m pay - off to which he was entitled following the troubled power group ' s takeover by dynegy .
mr lay , who oversaw enron ' s rapid rise and its subsequent collapse and sale to dynegy , was due the payment under an employment contract he extended when he resumed full control of the company in august 2001 .
however mr lay decided yesterday after meeting with some enron employees that he would turn down the payment .
"" ken lay will not accept the dollars 60 m when he leaves , "" an enron spokeswoman said . "" he felt like it was not the right thing to do . ""
according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission , mr lay is entitled to dollars 20 . 2 m in cash for every remaining year in his employment contract if he leaves enron within 60 days of the company being taken over .
mr lay ' s decision is in sharp contrast to other senior us executives who have negotiated - and accepted - "" golden parachutes "" which guarantee them large payments even if they oversaw large - scale destruction in shareholder value .
mr lay had previously come under fire from shareholders for selling some of his enron shareholding before the collapse in the company ' s stock price . between january and july this year , he sold enron shares with an estimated value of more than dollars 27 . 5 m .
at the close of trading yesterday enron was valued at dollars 7 . 5 bn , compared with a peak of dollars 65 . 9 bn in august last year .
the terms were part of mr lay ' s original employment contract , which had been due to expire in december 2003 . but in august , following the sudden departure of chief executive jeff skilling , enron ' s board extended mr lay ' s contract by two years .
at the time , the contract extension was seen as an attempt by mr lay to restore investor confidence in the company . but it also ensured he would receive an additional dollars 40 . 4 m if he left following a sale .
after the dollars 10 . 8 bn dynegy takeover , mr lay is expected to give up his executive responsibilities . he may join the combined group ' s board of directors but this will not affect his eligibility for a pay - off . the deal , which requires the approval of us competition authorities , is expected to be completed next year .

enron chief relinquishes severance pay

enron corp . chief executive kenneth l . lay on tuesday waived a severance payment of at least $ 60 million due him when dynegy inc . completes its expected acquisition of enron next year , company officials said .
the potential payment , disclosed in a securities and exchange commission regulatory filing tuesday , would undoubtedly have sparked additional controversy , given lay ' s primary role in the sharp fall of enron ' s stock and worsening financial condition , which led to the dynegy deal .
the payment would have been one of the biggest rewards for failure in corporate history , said graef crystal , a leading compensation expert .
the payment would have topped the nearly $ 40 million mattel inc . paid former chief executive jill barad after she was ousted in 2000 after spending $ 3 . 6 billion to purchase a money - losing software business the company eventually gave away to a technology group in return for a slice of future profit .
it would have been almost double the $ 35 million in severance collected by former xerox corp . chief executive richard thoman when he was fired in may 2000 after a disastrous reorganization of the copier company ' s sales force .
according to enron spokeswoman karen denne , lay spoke to a number of employees tuesday and "" decided that the best course of action would be for him to waive his right to payment . ""
"" instead , "" denne said , "" the combined company would decide the best use of those funds . ""
lay and enron have run into a storm of criticism in recent weeks after the disclosure of a series of partnerships and the dismissal of several top executives who invested in those ventures .
news of the partnerships and their losses forced the houston - based company to restate its earnings last week , reducing corporate profits over the last four years by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion .
shareholders have filed a series of lawsuits against enron , charging the company with failing to disclose key information about its operations and financial structure .
the negative disclosures sparked a cash crunch and threatened enron with collapse until it was saved by an agreement friday to be acquired by houston - based dynegy for $ 9 billion .
shareholders have watched the value of enron shares decline almost 90 % from a high of nearly $ 90 on aug . 23 , 2000 . its shares closed tuesday at $ 9 . 98 , up 74 cents , on the new york stock exchange .
ceo already reaped
$ 150 million in options
according to the regulatory filing , lay stood to collect $ 20 . 2 million a year , plus certain extraordinary tax expenses , for each of the full years remaining on his contract once the company was acquired .
if the dynegy deal is completed as expected next year , lay ' s payment would have totaled at least $ 60 . 6 million . his contract ends on dec . 31 , 2005 .
lay already reaped about $ 150 million in stock option gains the last two years alone . those gains were in part made possible by rosy enron profit statements , which the company restated downward last week , crystal said .
"" it is a good move to waive the payment , "" crystal said . "" but that ' s just the down payment on what he should give back . there is probably another $ 100 million in option profits he should give back . had they correctly stated the books , the stock would not have risen as high and he would not have made as much from exercising his stock options in the company . ""
a stock option gives the holder the right to purchase a share of a company at a predetermined price . options are a common executive pay incentive , allowing the individual to purchase and sell the shares , pocketing the gains in their appreciation . lay made $ 123 million off such transactions last year and $ 26 million this year , crystal said .
lay since 1989 has had a "" change of control "" clause that awards him a special payment if enron changes hands . the company described the clause as a standard part of executive employment agreements common to many companies .
some wall street analysts said the liability for the payment would be dynegy ' s problem at the point the merger is completed . enron shareholders already have suffered all the damage they are going to see .
"" enron has clearly lost the vast majority of its shareholders over the last six months with its piecemeal disclosure , destruction of shareholder value and loss of credibility , "" said andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york .
john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said the company was aware of the severance clause and had factored the expense into its acquisition , which "" we believe is a very strong financial transaction "" regardless of the potential payment to lay .

enron ceo says no to $ 60 . 6 million

kenneth lay , chairman and chief executive of enron corp . , decided yesterday to forgo an expected $ 60 . 6 million severance payment because of the impact of enron ' s plunging stock price on the company ' s employees , a spokesman said .
until yesterday , lay was preparing to accept the severance payout , which would be triggered at the completion of enron ' s purchase by rival houston energy company dynegy inc . , a deal announced on friday . enron faced a cash crisis after disclosing it has overstated its earnings by $ 586 million over the past four years because of improper accounting treatment of its investments in outside partnerships that were managed by its chief financial officer .
the severance package was reported yesterday by bloomberg news , which included a blistering comment by andrew whalley , manager of a trust that sold $ 5 million in enron stock in april because of concerns with enron ' s financial reports , bloomberg said .
whalley called the settlement "" a ridiculous amount of money "" to pay the chairman of a company that suffered "" a textbook financial collapse , where he obviously had some knowledge of what was going on . ""
enron spokesman karen denne said around midafternoon yesterday that lay intended to donate one - third of the severance to enron employees , keep one - third and use the remainder to pay taxes on the entire package . lay , who built enron into the world ' s largest energy trading company , was entitled to a payment of $ 20 . 2 million multiplied by each year remaining on his employment contract if it was terminated before it expires at the end of 2005 . the purchase by dynegy is expected to close in 2002 , assuming regulatory approvals are forthcoming , giving lay three years of payments . lay said last week that he will retire once the deal is done .
denne checked again with lay later in the afternoon and was told that he had decided not to accept any of the severance payment after a meeting yesterday with enron employees . "" he realized this was extremely sensitive given the financial condition of enron employees , "" denne said .
many enron employees hold the company ' s stock in savings and retirement plans , and the stock price has fallen from a high of $ 90 a share in august 2000 to a low of $ 8 . 41 last thursday .
enron ' s price has picked up since the purchase announcement , closing at $ 9 . 98 yesterday . dynegy has agreed to pay $ 23 billion for enron , about $ 10 billion of that in stock ( about $ 10 a share , when the deal was announced ) , while assuming enron debt for the rest .
lay ' s compensation was increased nearly threefold , to $ 18 . 3 million , last year , when the company ' s annual revenue reached $ 100 billion and its stock hit an all - time high .
lay realized a gain of $ 123 . 4 million from exercising stock options last year . he is entitled to purchase 782 , 830 shares of enron stock over the next seven years through stock options , according to a company filing , but those grants currently are worthless because of the collapse of enron ' s stock price .

enron ' s lay sells shareholdings in other companies , wsj reports
2001 - 11 - 14 05 : 53 ( new york )
houston , nov . 14 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . chairman and
chief executive officer kenneth lay has been selling shares of
companies of which he is a board member , the wall street journal
said .
lay sold about $ 1 . 2 million , or more than 25 percent of his
interest , in compaq computer corp . , where he has been a director
for 14 years , the paper reported .
he also sold 16 percent of his stake , or about 10 , 000 shares ,
in drugmaker eli lilly mikhail gorbachev , former president of the soviet union ; and colin powell , u . s . secretary of state .
however , greenspan declined the cash and crystal sculpture that accompany the prize .
it ' s logical that greenspan talked about energy , considering the award is named for an energy trading company , the institute is researching energy supply and security issues , and the home of the institute is the world ' s energy capital .
"" as we , as economic policymakers , understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of sept . 11 and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events , it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long - term economic growth , "" greenspan said .
"" one of the most important objectives of those policies should be an assured availability of energy . that imperative has , if anything , been elevated by the heightened tensions in the middle east - - an area that harbors two - thirds of the world ' s proven oil reserves . ""
greenspan reviewed the nation ' s experiences with seesawing energy prices and episodes of imbalances in supply and demand . he also discussed technologies to augment energy supplies , including coal mining , nuclear power and fusion power .
"" energy issues present policymakers and citizens with difficult decisions and trade - offs to make outside the market process ; as always , national security and environmental concerns need to be addressed in setting policy , "" greenspan said .
at the end of the speech , greenspan answered pre - selected written queries from the audience of students , faculty and invited guests . one questioner asked if the state of economy caused greenspan to second - guess his monetary policies .
greenspan rephrased the question as to whether or not he had made a mistake . after much rhetoric , he in effect said no .
"" the notion that people have that monetary policy changes one little notch and the economy goes up , clearly has never been the case and is not the case today , "" greenspan said .
the evening ended with james baker , former u . s . secretary of state and of the treasury , and ken lay , head of enron , presenting greenspan with the award .
rice university officials said it ' s premature to know whether the name of the enron prize will be changed if the sale of enron to dynegy is completed .
lay indicated the award would live on when he said , "" i ' m looking forward to our first woman recipient . ""

houston , nov 13 ( reuters ) - enron corp chairman ken lay has turned down the chance to cash in on his company ' s financial troubles by refusing to accept a $ 60 million payment due him if a proposed buyout by power - trading rival dynegy inc goes through , a company spokeswoman said on tuesday .
he decided it was not right to take the money under the circumstances now confronting the company , enron spokeswoman anne denne said .
enron , the nation ' s top trader of gas and electricity , agreed on friday to be bought by the much - smaller dynegy in a stock swap worth about $ 9 billion after a controversy over questionable business deals had sapped its finances to the point of near - collapse .
"" after having discussions with employees today he decided that this is the right thing to do and he ' s going to leave it up to the combined company to determine the best use of that money , "" denne told reuters .
lay ' s contract , which runs through 2005 , calls for him to get $ 20 . 2 million for each full year left in his contract if enron is taken over by another company . enron and dynegy officials have said they expect to complete their merger by the third quarter of next year .
denne said the clause , which is known in corporate circles as a "" golden parachute , "" has been in his contract since 1989 and is a "" standard provision "" for chief executives .
denne said lay told enron employees of his decision in a company - wide e - mail .
enron has been under the gun from wall street since mid - october when it said shareholder equity had been cut $ 1 . 2 billion because of off - the - balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the u . s . securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into the transactions , which sent enron ' s stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit .
on friday , enron and dynegy said they had agreed to merge at what seemed a firesale price for enron , which last year had $ 100 billion in revenues and $ 1 billion in earnings .
also , on tuesday night , lay presented the enron prize for distinguished public service to federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in an event at rice university in houston . previous winners have included the likes of nelson mandela and mikhail gorbachev .
prior to accepting the award , greenspan told students that the most important thing for anyone in the business world was to be ethical .
"" i don ' t deny that there is an extraordinary amount of activity in the business community which is less than exemplary . . . but the best chance you have of making a big success in this world is to decide from square one that you ' re going to do it ethically , "" he said .

enron chairman lay decides to forgo $ 60 . 6 million severance payment

enron corp . said its chairman , kenneth lay , has decided to forgo a severance payment of $ 60 . 6 million that could be triggered by dynegy inc . ' s planned acquisition of enron , wednesday ' s wall street journal reported .
mr . lay ' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice .
early in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay ' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities .
but by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn ' t attend the traders ' meeting , senior managers told him that "" opinions were expressed that he shouldn ' t receive the payment , "" mr . palmer said . "" he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . "" the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day .
the initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . "" things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , "" mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director .
for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation .
enron ( ene ) , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy ( dyn ) for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies .
separately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board "" failed in its responsibility "" to monitor the activities of enron executives .

houston ( ap ) - enron corp . chairman ken lay turned down up to dlrs 60 . 6 million that he stood to receive once the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas is merged into its smaller , but stronger rival dynegy inc .
"" he has told the employees that he has given a lot of thought to this over the last few days and in light of the circumstances surrounding the company and after listening to the employees he has decided the best thing to do is waive his right to the payment , "" enron spokesman vance meyer said .
lay decided it best to forego the enron compensation package after consulting with employees tuesday . he let those who work for him know of his decision via voicemail .
meyer said the compensation package was the only merger - related payment lay was eligible for from enron . a dynegy spokesman , john sousa , said the company was unsure if lay could receive a retirement package from them .
enron had a conference call scheduled for 1430 gmt .
dynegy ' s purchase of enron , worth at least dlrs 9 . 8 billion in stock , would trigger a clause in lay ' s contract that gives him a lump sum of dlrs 20 . 2 million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of enron , according to documents filed tuesday with the securities and exchange commission .
lay ' s contract with houston - based enron runs through 2005 .
dynegy executives have said they hope to complete their acquisition of enron by next summer . the houston - based energy marketer will assume dlrs 13 billion of enron debt . the enron name will vanish when the deal is completed .
investors continued to bid up both companies ' shares tuesday , in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal . dynegy shares rose dlrs 2 . 63 , or 6 percent , to close at dlrs 44 . 94 on the new york stock exchange , where enron shares rose 74 cents , or 8 percent , to close at dlrs 9 . 98 .
enron shares have gained 17 percent since thursday , the day before the merger was announced , but the shares are still a fraction of their 52 - week high of dlrs 84 . 87 .
dynegy entered talks to buy enron last month as the trading giant ' s stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks following enron ' s posting of a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss . the company also disclosed a dlrs 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to partnerships run by company officers , which allowed enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books .
those partnerships are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran some of the partnerships , and restated its earnings back to 1997 . but those actions failed to restore investor confidence .
chuck watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , will retain those roles for the combined company while lay steps down when the deal is done .
enron spokeswoman karen denne said tuesday the compensation provision given a merger or other change of control has been in lay ' s contract since 1989 . such protections are common for chief executive officers , she said .
in february , jeff skilling replaced lay as president and ceo of enron and lay retained his title as chairman . lay stepped back into the other roles when skilling unexpectedly resigned in august , citing personal reasons .

enron ' s ceo to turn down $ 60 . 6 million severance pay
by laura goldberg
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
ken lay , enron corp . ' s chairman and chief executive , won ' t take the $ 60 . 6 million in severance he would be due after dynegy closes its deal to buy his troubled company .
lay made his decision tuesday after employees ' sentiments about the money were relayed to him , enron spokesman mark palmer said .
at a floor meeting tuesday for energy traders and marketers and back - office employees to discuss the merger , lay ' s severance "" was a very active topic apparently , "" palmer said , adding that "" quite a bit of concern "" was expressed .
documents on a variety of enron matters , including lay ' s severance , were filed with federal securities regulators tuesday morning .
under his employment contract , if lay ends his employment within 60 days of a so - called "" change of control , "" he gets a lump - sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years left in his employment contract times $ 20 . 2 million .
the merger was announced friday , but isn ' t expected to close for six to nine months . lay ' s contract runs through dec . 31 , 2005 .
palmer said a change - of - control clause had been in lay ' s contract since 1989 .
lay won ' t have a management role with the combined company to be called dynegy . he ' s been offered a seat on the new board , but hasn ' t decided whether to take it .
lay ' s contract was set to expire on dec . 31 , 2003 , but was extended in august after ceo jeff skilling unexpectedly resigned and lay jumped back into his former job as chief executive .
declining the money , palmer said , was the best way for lay to assure employees that he wouldn ' t profit from the severance provision .
last year , lay made $ 18 . 3 million from various forms of compensation , including a $ 7 million bonus , according to enron ' s march proxy statement .
he was also awarded options to buy 782 , 830 shares of enron stock at specified prices over a number of years . the options , though , are worthless at current enron stock prices .
this year through aug . 21 , lay made $ 25 . 5 million by exercising options and selling those shares , graef crystal , a compensation expert who writes a column for bloomberg news , said .
lay made an average of $ 31 . 5 million a year from 1993 to 2000 in various forms of compensation , including exercising options and selling the shares , crystal said .
dynegy on friday announced a deal to buy its rival for almost $ 9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $ 13 billion in debt and $ 2 billion in preferred stock .
the price came at bargain - basement rates for a company whose shares as recently as late january closed at $ 82 . tuesday , shares in enron closed at $ 9 . 98 .
among enron ' s woes : a securities and exchange commission investigation , questions on wall street about its financial reporting practices and shareholder lawsuits .
investors reacted negatively to word that lay could get $ 60 . 6 million .
"" this is ridiculous after what has happened , "" said donald coxe , who manages the harris insight equity fund , which at the end of last month owned about 78 , 000 shares of enron . "" the idea that there would be a golden parachute for somebody who as a parachute captain sent his stockholders out of the plane without a parachute strikes me as pretty odd . ""
even before tuesday , lay had other ideas for the severance .
early last week , palmer said lay proposed to chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , that he get two - thirds of what he was due in a noncash payment , such as stock in the merged company .
with half of the noncash payment , lay wanted to set up a foundation to provide assistance to enron employees in need .
a significant portion of the rest , according to his plan , would have been cash to cover taxes .
dynegy declined immediate comment about lay ' s tuesday decision .
but carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , quipped : "" that might stave off one shareholder lawsuit . ""

enron offers reasons for selling to dynegy
underperforming assets , heavy debt cited
by laura goldberg
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
among enron corp . ' s reasons for agreeing to be bought out by rival dynegy : underperforming assets were draining cash and earnings , and debt load was stretching the company .
that enron faced a loss of confidence from financial markets and departures of some senior executives also played into the decision , documents filed by enron on tuesday with federal securities regulators said .
before agreeing to a merger with dynegy , enron also considered staying independent , an infusion of private equity and an infusion from a strategic partner .
friday , the two companies announced dynegy would buy enron for almost $ 9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $ 13 billion in debt and $ 2 billion in preferred stock .
under the deal , enron shareholders get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . the ratio is subject to "" downward revision "" under certain circumstances , the documents said .
also , chevrontexaco , a dynegy shareholder , gave dynegy $ 1 . 5 billion . dynegy on tuesday injected that money into enron , aiming to shore up its core energy trading operation .
in return for the money , dynegy gets preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . if the deal doesn ' t close , dynegy could buy all of northern natural gas , which includes about 17 , 000 miles of natural gas pipeline .
the filings say dynegy ' s right to buy northern natural gas is first subject to a right of enron to repurchase northern natural gas . if the merger should not close , dynegy , under certain circumstances , has the option instead to convert its stake in northern natural gas to enron stock .
also of note in the documents :
? enron will finish its second downtown office tower , now under construction , and will keep moving employees into the new building "" at this time . ""
? the merged company will assume the "" rights and obligations "" under enron ' s naming - rights deal for enron field .
enron also made filings with the securities and exchange commission concerning agreements announced nov . 1 to get $ 1 billion in credit lines from j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup .
the filing detailed a provision in those agreements that , based on enron ' s current credit rating , would have prevented it from tapping those lines . an enron spokesman said tuesday the banks have waived that provision .
also tuesday , enron said it named company executive raymond bowen jr . as treasurer to replace ben glisan , who was fired last week .
dynegy stock continued its upward movement tuesday , closing $ 2 . 63 higher at $ 46 . 94 .

"" that ' s a ridiculous amount of money for a man who ' s already made himself probably tens of millions of dollars , "" said andrew whalley , manager of the legg mason international utilities trust , which sold a $ 5 - million stake in enron in april because of concern about its bookkeeping .
"" it ' s a classic golden parachute , "" said raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright , noting that it is comparable to financial safety nets in other top corporate contracts .
but shareholders might not appreciate the parachute given the once - mighty company ' s recent troubles , mr . cartwright said .
"" that ' s a tough call , "" he said . "" it certainly would have been fair if you had been looking at enron up to a couple of months ago . following that it gets dicey , and i ' m not sure how shareholders are going to take it . ""
investors continued to bid up both companies ' shares yesterday in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal . dynegy shares rose $ 2 . 63 , or 6 per cent , to close at $ 44 . 94 on the new york stock exchange , where enron shares rose 74 cents , or 8 per cent , to close at $ 9 . 98 .

kenneth lay , chairman and chief executive of enron , is in line for compensation of more than $ 60 m ( # 42 m ) if he leaves the us company following its $ 8 billion rescue by its smaller rival dynegy .
according to documents filed with america ' s securities & exchange commission , mr lay is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to $ 20 . 2 m for every year remaining on his contract . his contract expires at the end of 2005 , while dynegy ' s takeover of enron , announced on friday , is due to be completed in the third quarter of next year .
the contract was extended by two years in august , when he resumed chief executive duties following the departure of jeffrey skilling . it provides that , in addition to his compensation , he will receive an extra amount to cover tax penalties if the sum he gets is considered to be an "" excess parachute payment "" .
enron , once valued at $ 80 billion , has seen its shares lose 80 pc in the past three weeks after announcing a $ 586 m loss , an equity write - down and a regulatory inquiry into off balance sheet dealings .

mark to market : retail sales to surge on free money
by jim murphy
11 / 14 / 2001
capital markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - professionals and amateurs alike agree that at 8 : 30 a . m . est the commerce department will report that u . s . retail sales rose in october .
some observers believe that retail sales not only rose last month , but that they surged - 5 . 5 % being the top of the forecast range .
all again agree that the main stimulant was the zero - percent financing offered by the major automakers .
in september , sadness and other negative emotions engendered by the events of 9 / 11 helped to fashion a 2 . 4 % drop in overall retail sales and a 1 . 6 % decline when auto sales were excluded .
the dow jones newswires median forecast of 21 economists has it that overall retail sales rose 2 . 5 % in october , while they were ahead only 0 . 4 % when auto sales were excluded .
while it is difficult to believe that any market will move lower in response to a notable improvement in retail sales , the most compelling ways in which the report can be "" spun "" are all negative .
a few examples . the october increase will be from a depressed september level .
yes , october retail sales were goosed by zero - percent financing , but november won ' t get such a lift even though the zero - percent sales campaign isn ' t over yet .
that ' s because even if "" free "" money lured me out of my shell and into the showroom in october , it will have no effect on me in november or in december . i already bought a new car . unless i ' m a rich collector , that ' s it for at least year or two .
the more metaphysical of commentators will also note that many october car sales spurred by zero - percent financing were "" in a very real sense "" stolen from subsequent months . without "" free "" money , i might , for example , have waited until april of 2002 before buying a new car .
then , too , there is the cost to the automakers of the zero - interest loans . gm ' s general motors acceptance corp . , which finances the parent ' s cars , will remain a profit center , but it won ' t be from auto loans made in october .
i ' ll leave the summing to a professional ( because i agree with him ) .
"" retail sales probably reversed the plunge in september , although mainly because of a spike in autos that is unlikely to be sustained for more than one month , "" said jim o ' sullivan , economist at ubs warburg .
vienna meeting overshadowed
oil ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting ministers began meeting today in vienna .
most oil traders are looking for them to cut daily output by around 1 . 5 million barrels . but who ever really knows with opec , which i have cleverly punned , more than once , into opaque .
besides there ' s a war going on in afghanistan and oil - rich iraq may be next - and who knows but that the house of saud won ' t be toppled by islamic fundamentalists . to name but a few topics that are more compelling than a periodic quota buck - and - wing by opec .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

Attn: Directors /CEO,

May I have the pleasure of introducing myself, I am Mr. Elliot Kabangu a senior staff and chairman of tender board committee on the award of contracts for 2010 FIFA world cup in department of works and housing here in South Africa. I got your email from an International Business Directory. In my quest to find a trustworthy person on whom I can repose confidence for colossal international money transaction I came in contact with your details.

My aim of sending this business proposal to you is to solicit for your assistance and co-operation to transfer some huge amount of money into your account overseas. Therefore, this communication should be held in high confidence.

My colleague and I in the department of works and land affairs wish to transfer into a safe and secured account overseas, the sum of US$35,500,000.00 (Thirty Five Million and Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which was over-invoiced amount from contracts we awarded to foreign contractors for the preparation of the 2010 FIFA world cup which will be paid in the first quarter of 2010.

This money has been released by the government and is right now is in a coded account in the First National bank of South Africa. However, by virtue of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this fund in our names or in the names of any companies here in South Africa. I was therefore asked by my colleagues on trust and sincerity to look for a reliable international outfit partner abroad into whose account the sum of US$35.5 Million will be transferred. We have agreed on the following, if you accept our proposal, Seventy percent (70%) will be for us and Thirty percent (30%) for you.

My choice of you for this transaction is basically hanged on your field and profession. If you are interested in this deal, I will require some information from you in order to affect the transfer of the money. Please, be informed that we shall commence processing of claims of payment once we receive your interest from you. I will use my position here to influence all the paper; I will also include you in our database as one of the contract. Note that this transaction is risk free.

I will appreciate, if you will send your response via email as indicated above.

Best Regards
Mr. Elliot Kabangu

Attention,

After several attempts to reach you I deemed it necessary and urgent to notify you finally about your outstanding settlement of your overdue fund. I resumed duty recently as The Accountant General of Malaysia, to Harmonize and reconcile public debts (SUB SECTION IFM POLICY). This office was set up by the WORLD BANK, to reconcile and COMPENSATE all foreign Contractors/Inheritance Award winning claims with a part mayment of  $4,500,000.00 (FOUR MILLION AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). It has been scheduled to be paid to you through International Certified Bank Draft, cashable in the bank of your choice.  I am committed to upholding and defending the constitution and laws of WORLD BANK as well as achieving a higher level of public safety and security through the prosecution of criminals.

The purpose of this office among others is to investigate, verify and settle all outstanding debts owed and records before me. I have revealed that your payment has not been effected as a result of official negligence as many irregularities had happened in the Bank where some top officials of the Apex Bank collaborate with impostors who are carrying fake portfolios misled and misguided YOU about the position of your fund and having the opportunity to extort money from you. The security of your data and transactions is crucial to us, we therefore apply one of the best security standards available (128 bit SSL), this (SSL) applies to the business relationship and supplements any agreements made by individual contract.

Meanwhile, Did you authorise anybody to claim your fund on your behalf? we need your urgent response because your file had  problem due to a petition filed by one Mr.Edgar Carlos from Peru claiming to be your Attorney and that you have handed him  the ownership of your fund .

He sent us the acoount below claiming  that it where your money will be paid  into:

BANCO DE CREDITO DEL PERU.
NÂ° de cuenta 245-13592091-1-42 ,
C?digo SWFT  NÂ° BCPLPEPL .

Based on the information we received, it is mandatory and compulsory that you reconfirm your contact information to us for further advice and also for the programming of the information in the micro chip compartment of this commission if actually you are not aware of the change of account for immediate release of your fund.

Yours sincerely,

At this development I asked them who authorized them to come down to BENIN REPUBLIC for the Collection of this Payment and they told me that you asked them to come and collect this funds on your Behalf. Infact this was the biggest shock that this Bank have ever received so far because your Inheritance funds of the sum ($10.5Millions) of atm mastercard is still in the ""Federal Suspense Account"" of Zenith  Bank, yet you sent these men to come and collect this Funds on your behalf without Notifying us.

We in this Bank, do not understand why you sent these men to come and
Collect your Funds on your behalf. If actually you want them to help
you collect your Inheritance Bill Sum of $10.5Millions of atm
mastercard , at least you should have informed me as the Director of
this Bank.

They actually tendered some vital documents which proved that you actually sent them for the collection of these Funds. Honestly, it really baffles me that you took such decision without my consent. Listen very carefully to enable us know the truth in this matter. you need to contact below Email address immediately  for confirmation.

Here is the documents which they tendered to this Bank today:
1. LETTER OF AUTHORITY.
2. IRREVOCABLE PAYMENT GUARANTEE.

Actually, these documents which they tendered to this Noble Bank are a clear Proof that you sent them to Collect this Funds for you. Finally, (I told them to come back within three working days and they promised to come back and pay for the delivery  and processing fee of the sum $180 only) on your behalf to enable them claim the inheritance bill sum of ($10.5M) credited into atm mastercard were Re-deposited into the ""Federal Suspense Account"" of Zenith  Bank Benin Republic last month due to your  relent/procrastination effort to come to claim it.

As the Governor of this Noble Bank, I was supposed to Release this Funds to them but I refused to do so because I wanted to hear from you first if the delivery and processing fee of the sum $180 can be taken care by this people to enable us release this inheritance claim bill sum of the ($10.5M) on their favour . Due to the Nature of my job, I will not want to make any mistake in releasing these funds to anyone except you whom is the recognized bonafide beneficiary to This Fund,so get back to this bank immediately to enable us instruction you what to do on this issue and how to make this payment for the delivery and processing of the your atm card.

Greetings to you, 

With due respect and humanity , and forced me to write to you under the ground of humanity. My name is Ms. Veronica Anderson . I was born in Baltimore , Maryland , and I am married to the director , Mr. Maxwell Anderson JC industry, Cote d'Ivoire. We were married for 36 years without a child . 
He died after a heart bypass operation . Recently , my doctor told me that I will not continue for the next six months because of the problemsof cancer ( lever and stroke ) . Before the death of my husband in the last year there is this amount of 6.2 million dollars he deposited in a bank here in , Cote d'Ivoire. Presently this money is still in the bank.
Having known my condition I decided to donate to this fund to any individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here . I want someone who will use this fund according to the desire of my late husband to help people less fortunate , and orphanages , and poor families with many children . I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this fund , and I do not want in away where this money will be used in a manner ungodly . That is why I am taking this decision to hand you over this Fund . I am not afraid of death hence I know where I'm going . I want you to remember me always in my prayers everyday because even upcoming cancer surgery . Writing again as soon as possible any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose . 
Your sincerely ,

Salaam my dear

I am happy to see your mail to me, thanks darling, I hope you are fine; my dear I feel reliable in you so much and secure that is all my trust in you, please I would like to remind you that I will offer you 30% of the whole money for your nice assistance in making sure that every thing is done, after the money transferred to your country and 5% for any expenses we make ok, and 65% for me for the purpose of that investment and since I trust you, it must be under your control because you know your country very well more than me.

My dear I request that we cultivate some trust within us in order to map a way forward,  Please do not hesitate to communicate to me the plan that you have already thought of. I do appreciate your eagerness to give me new home again after school.

 Please promise me you are not going to hurt or disappoint me when the fund is finally transferred into your account,

However i have managed to get a lawyer through a friend here. I would like you to contact my lawyer so that he can explain the way forward and exactly what we should do legally in detail.

Also allow me to give your contact details to him as well so that he can contact you in person. I would like at the receipt of this mail to you, please write to him ( my Lawyer)  with bellow information stating his help in assisting us and directing us in best way to get this money released from the present bank, and transferred to your destination, for investing purpose as I told you in my previous mail.

 Here is my lawyers contact.

Attorney name:  Barr. Hassen Nasheed.
Email address: brrhassennasheed@live.com.my

May I request that you provide me with your
Address.....................
Country of Origin............,
Occupation................
Marital Status.............
phone number ...........

so that I can present these to our lawyer for easier identification. More so I have been discussing with the lawyer on how best we will execute the inheritance. I have agreed to offer you partnership in my inheritance only if you abide by the rules and regulations demanded by the law in order for you to be able to assist me in investing in your country. However I would greatly appreciate you update me any form of correspondence between yourself and the lawyer.

In the meantime you can do a feasibility study on the kind of business that we can legally invest in and please do advise me on time. Again I need to emphasize on the issue of confidentiality. You are to keep this matter in strict confidence as it is a matter of life and death in my country. Please avoid the involvement of any third parties in this matter to maintain confidentiality until this fund gets into your possession.

Kind Regards to your family

Dear, Friend. 
 
I am Mr. Hazim Issa the Bill and Exchange Manager at the Foreign Remittance Department of African Development Bank (ADB).I has an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. That could help you and me.
 
On Oct 6, 2003, A Malaysian physician/Contractor with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mr Subramaniam Muthuveran from Selangor Malaysian national deposited the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine Million Dollars only) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) that Mr Subramaniam Muthuveran died in a plane crash with his entire family in 2004 which involved with Flash Airline that occurred on the 4Th of January 2004.
 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that In the bank form for next of kin, that Mr Subramaniam Muthuveran Before his death filled his wife Susan Muthuveran as his next of kin but unfortunately, the wife died with him along others and therefore, there is nobody left behind to claim the fund of Mr Subramaniam Muthuveran as his next of kin that was the reason why I contacted you and proposed it as a deal between us. Meanwhile, According to the Burkina Faso Law, under Burkina's foreign and defense affairs, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, such funds will revert to the ownership of the Burkina Faso Government for financing military  operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunition for the military. In order to avert this negative development, I will like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr Subramaniam Muthuveran so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in general.
 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 40% for you and 60% for me. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done accordingly and with my position as the bill and exchange guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately so that I will instruct you on what to do next. Finally, you should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 
Anxiously am waiting to hearing from you.

Thanks,
Best regards.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

 Hi,

My name is Sir Edward Allen (KSC) in Stoke-On-Trent, United Kingdom, where are you from? Are you a dedicated Christian or Muslim? I needed someone to trust with a charity. According to my doctor, I was diagnosed with esophageal lung cancer. I will die a moment. I want you to distribute these funds to the people who need it.

Please, you know that I am weak now and the doctor said I would die soon, so I need to rest because of my health, so I need you to help me distribute the fund to the needs, so I want your help and I distribute the fund for works of charity, my God is the person who brought you to me, I am so happy that I can finally find a great person, like David and John in the Bible and the name of my late Ashari, I lost them with my wife and my 2 beautiful Daughters, in a plane crash in Sebreneska, Eastern Europe, in 1985, since then I have remained single, just me and my business, until I suffered from this esophageal cancer disease. Esophageal cancer is a cancerous (malignant) tumor of the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach.

I will wait for your response here before continuing and informing my lawyer about my intentions.

Thanks
Edward Allen.",1,1,"[""\u0120beautiful"", ""\u0120D"", ""aughters"", ""\u0120you"", ""\u0120God"", ""\u0120Bible"", ""\u01202"", ""\u0120plane"", ""\u0120crash"", ""\u0120fund""]","[2.2459593865432446e-05, 2.2455576365276917e-05, 2.1356962506769826e-05, 1.5362373106755615e-05, 1.4948592353094784e-05, 1.4820299242849403e-05, 1.4577534491732969e-05, 1.0477372243412438e-05, 1.0473180120274173e-05, 8.724968407362227e-06]","[""needed"", ""Sir"", ""KSC"", ""with"", ""My"", ""people"", ""Trent"", ""lost"", ""from"", ""happy""]","[1.5297587559517688e-05, 1.382056929256642e-05, 1.3737101373049284e-05, 1.3727241205984567e-05, 1.3629269097449293e-05, 1.2681589837241872e-05, 6.6465136860390445e-06, 6.480718982075352e-06, 4.570598381077798e-06, 3.817059710943062e-07]"

subject : sitara eol bridge problem today
the problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets ( 2098073 , 2099764 ) not having startdate and enddate . missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up . ( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .
the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

ATTN,

Request for Urgent Business Relationship

We have the pleasure to make this surprising but mutually benefiting business proposal. I am a member of the newly inaugurated committee for the privatization of the refineries of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, in Nigeria. The members of the committee are interested in the importation of goods into the country with funds presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria / Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) foreign payments account. I got your address through the office of the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The federal military government of Nigeria intends to lease the three existing petroleum refineries to private individuals and companies. This is to make the refineries more viable, resourceful and to eliminate undue wastage and fraud. This privatization is in-line with the recommendations of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a prerequisite for future financial assistance.

The refineries are heavily indebted to many companies and my committee has the mandate (task) of compiling the names of these companies and debt owed them and also recommend for payment, all contracts that have been fully executed. With our position in the committee, which comprises of my ministry, federal ministry of petroleum resources, Nigerian National Petroleum corporation (NNPC), the federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), we have successfully secured for ourselves, the sum of US $73,000,000 (seventy-three million United States Dollars).

This sum was acquired by carefully inflating the amount of indebtedness by this amount (US $73,000,000). We need a reliable company to be included in the list of companies to be paid. This company will be paid for a contract executed in Kaduna Refinery in year 2001.

I was therefore mandated in trust by members of the committee, to seek a foreign partner into whose account we could transfer the sum of US $73,000,000, hence I am writing you this letter. We have agreed to share the funds thus:

1) 70% for us (the committee members)
2) 20% for you (the account owner)
3) 10% will be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses that will be incurred in the course of this transaction. It is from our 70% that we wish to commence the importation business.
We also need assurance from you that you will let us have our share once the inflated amount (US $73,000,000.00) is transferred into your account.
The payment will be done by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through its correspondent bank. What we need from you is that you provide a vital account into which the funds will be transferred /lodged.

Note that this transaction is 100% safe and guaranteed since the law under which our committee was set up, has empowered us to disburse all the funds.
We shall commence the transfer of the funds immediately we receive the following information by you.
1) Your company name and full address:
2) Your telephone and fax number:

The above information will enable us put up letters of claim and job description to the respective ministries for the issuance of the mandatory fund release approval/recommendations. This way, your company will be recognized and accepted as the beneficiary of the contract entitlements before the final remittance to your nominated account, by the Central Bank of Nigeria, being paying bank.

Note that we will be responsible for the payment of the federal Inland Revenue tax on behalf of your company and a contract agreement between your company and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation shall be drawn up and antedated showing that your company has a legitimate contract with the NNPC and must be paid.

We are looking forward to doing this business with you and solicit absolute confidentiality from you in this transaction. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter, for more details regarding this transaction. Also endeavor to send the requested information, you can also reach me through my office telephone number ( 234-7093003540 ) for easy contact.

Mr. Tony Momor

subject : unify to sap interfaces
we interfaced unify to sap three times today . interface number one ( 8 : 40 am )
was error free . the second interface ( noon ) created duplicate invoices for
those sent in our first interface . the problem that caused the duplication
was that the flag in unify that prevents invoices from being sent to sap
after they have already been interfaced did not work . the problem was
corrected before out third interface at 3 : 15 pm . in the 3 : 15 interface , one
error occurred - - - a counterparty was set up in global as intercompany that
should be third party . this error will be corrected before our next interface
on 7 / 6 am .
overall , i was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast
the sap and unify teams responded to our issues .

Dear Beloved ,

I am Mrs Fanta Branco of Sao Tome & Principle. I am the Former Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure, Natural Resources, & Environment, under the Government of President Fradique de Menezes.

Acting in my capacity as minister of natural resources during the bidding for oil exploration rights in the gulf of guinea by several oil companies, I assisted a particular company to obtain one of the licenses.

After their bid succeeded, they gave me $18 Million in cash for my assistance.

I cannot introduce or circulate this amount into the banking system of my country because these reasons:

1. My provisional duty as a minister allows me to earn less than $1000 equivalent of Dobra (our local currency)
2. Strict stipulations of the Bureau of conduct guidelines and regulations for Public/Civil servants.
3. Due to the intense competition during the bidding for the oil exploration licenses, there are now investigations into how the whole process was handled.

4. Further more, Groups of persons’ in the Government have ganged up against me, with false allegations of an intention by me to contest the next presidential elections.

That was why I moved this Fund to the Capital City of Cotonou Republic of Benin in One INTERNATIONAL BANK for safety and security.

Presently I am in Cotonou for this purpose with my only Son, that is why I contacted you for your  co-operation to take delivery of the funds into your Account for investment purposes.

25% of the entire funds will be apportioned to you for your efforts and assistance. I urge you to accord this transaction the confidentiality and secrecy it deserves no matter what your decision may be. Please if you are interested, reply me.

Awaiting your response with urgency!

Mrs. Fanta Branco
Former Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure,
Natural Ressources, & Environnent
Sao Tome & Principle

dear ms . crenshaw :
i recently accepted a quant position with texaco in houston . lara berry
from enron contacted me just after that , and i told her of the situation .
i agreed to send her my resume ( which i did ) and keep in touch .
enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities . mr . kaminski
is very well known in the energy field , and i have read some of his
material . i am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me ;
however , i have given my word to texaco .
the texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk . this is the kind
of challenge for which i am looking . if things do not work out , however , i
would definitely contact enron again and cherish any opportunity for an
interview .
thank you very much ,

"Dear

Regarding our conversation before for the fund release options which I text to you through your cell phone last time, I have verified your fund payment files and the file states that your amount is worth of $2.5 Million and not $800,000.00 as you stated.

In this case, You are to follow below options and their release procedures so as to have the fund delivered to you.

1. Visa Card: Your total fund will be converted into an International UBA Visa card with your name written on it and have it delivered to your house address through a Courier delivery company, and give you the access to withdraw your funds Via ATM machines within your vicinity with a daily limit withdrawal of $6,500 per day.

2. Online Wire Transfer: You will get in touch with the issuing bank and have them register an Online Domiciliary Account in your name with the bank which will give you access to transfer your funds directly from the Online Bank into your designated bank account in your country through the Bank Internet Banking system.

3. Diplomatic Delivery; Your total fund will be packaged into a consignment box which will be handed over to a trusted Diplomat who will handle the delivery of the fund and have it delivered to your house address and hand the consignment box over to you.

The Diplomat must not know the content of the Box as it will be explained to him to be a Family Treasure box and the pin number can only be given to you once you confirm the receipt of the consignment box so as to avoid any form of opening. I believe i have been able to answer your questions in a bit you can understand each option, so you are to get back to me immediately on the choice that suits you so as to proceed on it's arrangement.

In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true,
compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary
for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you
just might get away with it!)However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must 
provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might
buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell
that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide
the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just
might make money at this, since there might be a market of
10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of
getting a binary.But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for
1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite
/bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of
the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost
(or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any
business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_
charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be
providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of
business faster than a dot-com in 2001.And there are real ways to provide this value for money
(convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a
friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates,
convenience of having what lots of other people have,
posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading
over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from
a ""real"" company, etc).There will be segments of the market that will pay various
amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't.
Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the
source will always be free (or minimal cost).Later,
Kenn

"Hello,

Please take your time to read this message; although we have never met before, this is no spam. It's a real message sent to you. I know also that you will be amazed at the level of trust that I am willing to place in a person that I have never seen nor spoken with.

My name is Fr. Kelvin Nelson, I am a catholic priest for over 55 years. I had a heart surgery on the 10-2-2011 and the Doctors have just informed me that I cannot live longer; I had a serious bleeding after the operation. I have decided to release to you the total sum of $2.970.000.00 (Two million Nine Hundred and seventy Thousand US DOLLARS) deposited with my Bank:I want you to use these amount to make the world a better place for the poor and less privileged, help the needy and also help your family members.

As a Catholic priest, I have no child, no wife, and no family. I have no other option as my days on earth are numbered, this is no joke. It's true we don't receive emails like this every day,  but today is a different day so it's time for ""REAL CHANGE"" I will turn 77 years a day after tomorrow.

I took this decision because I was raised in an Orphanage so I don't have relatives and presently, I'm hospitalized at a Benin hospital, where I am undergoing treatment. Thatâ€™s why I have decided to contact you so that you can make good use of the money which I willed to you. Now, the people around me are only waiting for me to die, so that they can sit on my money and use it for their selfish interest. I hate evil minded people and thatâ€™s why I want you to now contact my Lawyer:

Contact name: (Barrister) Laurence Alfred.. Email address: [laurence.alfred01@gmail.com] Office address: Rue 131 Saint Rita, Cotonou Benin Republic.

He will direct you on what to do to receive funds immediately; I have passed on my instructions to him so feel free to contact him. Please make sure you contact my Lawyer, he is the only one that can respond to you in due time. I wish you the very best in life. Always pray for my soul to rest in perfect peace, I would be a very happy man even in death if you use these funds for Good work to help humanity. I am 77 years old now and has been good to everyone around... please assure me that you would help me carry on the good work.

Fr. Kelvin Nelson

"for several months we have been working on an idea to exploit the staff and experience we have in special assets to develop a fee - for - service "" executive services "" business . the key idea is to participate in potentially rewarding companies and projects without commitment of enron ' s investment capital . i believe that this would be a logical extension in applying the skills and management approach we already are taking with our own portfolio .
as part of some initial feasibility evaluations , we recently have had discussions with bill gartland , a houston entrepreneur , with extensive contacts with national and provincial governmental development agencies in spain . gartland is seeking management and financial expertise to promote industrial , commercial and real estate projects in spain . among other things , he presently lacks the professional skills to evaluate and package projects for presentation to sophisticated capital providers in the united states and europe .
in addition to checking personal and business references , we had rick carson ' s group perform a due diligence review of mr . gartland . his background and reputation are clean .
through gartland ' s contacts we have been invited to meet with representatives with the sociedad estatal de participaciones indrustriales ( sepi ) , the spanish state - owned holding company for business development . in addition , we will meet with representatives of instituto de fomento ( info ) , the regional government of murcia ' s business development group . info has agreed to fund all of our incountry expenses while in murcia on this initial visit .
in order to take advantage of this opportunity we have accelerated our plans to test the market for the types of services we envisage providing and are scheduled to meet with sepi , info and other contacts in spain the week of june 11 th .
unfortunately , with the tight schedule we could not arrange a general meeting to cover the concept of enron executive services ( enronexec ) . however , we have prepared an informal presentation as a briefing prior to next week ' s trip .
i would stress the following points :
these initial meetings are informational and relationship focused . no commitments will be made next week .
one of the key principles of enronexec is that we are not a source of capital . among the services we offer will be analysis of capital needs and preparation of business and / or project plans for presentation to capital providers .
activities contemplated for enronexec will complement the normal workload of special assets . there will be no reduction in our efforts to achieve our primary business objectives for the team .
the expenses to evaluate the potential and , if viable , to startup the activity are modest and are consistent with our approved 2001 expense plan .
our eventual objective to fund enronexec is to structure cash fees at least sufficient to cover staff time and out - of - pocket costs . we will look to acquire significant equity participation that would offer the attractive potential value upside . as a byproduct benefit through contacts with various businesses , we may identify new synergies and opportunities for other enron businesses .
i am very enthusiastic on enronexec . it appears that it may be a way to leverage enron ' s unique resources and strengths into a profitable enterprise that does not require separate capital . i would appreciate your comments and questions .",0,0,"[""\u0120h"", ""\u0120entrepreneur"", ""ouston"", ""\u0120extensive"", ""\u0120experience"", ""\u0120working"", ""\u0120exploit"", ""\u0120develop"", ""<s>"", ""\u0120several""]","[0.0722965486681042, 0.0722965486681042, 0.07229654774600991, 0.07229654774600991, 0.05203084626441523, 0.05161617689788045, 0.04718873953856928, 0.04706814594334219, 0.04638390871582487, 0.04638390871582487]","[""enron"", ""as"", ""discussions"", ""several"", ""on"", ""part"", ""staff"", ""exploit"", ""business"", ""companies""]","[0.3215151274846939, 0.09883304080020366, 0.08125625904076958, 0.07733740680121455, 0.07290487556506879, 0.0662989940488398, 0.06533595934656851, 0.019774194583013986, 0.009403702216471427, 0.002832227340359655]"

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( yorick wilks ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st",0,0,"[""\u0120immediately"", ""\u0120conference"", ""rec"", ""\u0120gran"", ""\u0120international"", ""\u0120l"", ""ain"", ""ada"", ""\u0120sp"", ""\u0120ic""]","[0.07456266738578658, 0.06225953214146697, 0.06225953214146697, 0.06225953214146697, 0.062259531281852805, 0.062259531281852805, 0.03439407957617872, 0.03439407824919796, 0.03439407824919796, 0.007961883719863614]","[""linguistic"", ""announcement"", ""conference"", ""language"", ""on"", ""the"", ""workshop"", ""discuss"", ""evaluation"", ""deployment""]","[0.05965345275115581, 0.05382759936990825, 0.042056414149816986, 0.03845448555482545, 0.034694518289744306, 0.03162546158317509, 0.030240806885703138, 0.026742770713045438, 0.024410724254109038, 0.02255918735508185]"
"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"fred or anita ,
i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121
is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate
flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was
put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the
gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at
meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter
statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .
for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957
and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer
martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use
449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed
out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate
for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the
allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .
in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a
callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general
land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on
that yet .
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be
doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person
doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !",0,0,"[""ita"", ""\u0120recap"", ""i"", ""\u0120wanted"", ""\u0120just"", ""\u0120same"", ""page"", ""\u0120bra"", ""ley"", ""um""]","[0.1696869500962445, 0.14012688828590095, 0.0803610292243017, 0.060147627755137975, 0.06014762686906276, 0.029351311406506805, 0.02488945284777953, 0.018284401512641782, 0.018284401512641782, 0.018284400320044993]","[""allocation"", ""discussion"", ""recap"", ""i"", ""flow"", ""to"", ""calculate"", ""same"", ""page"", ""land""]","[0.03455451235248401, 0.031406701315818505, 0.03125145500415797, 0.027667119160412045, 0.026228742754962606, 0.024603746347568782, 0.02262080311752151, 0.019754277560470938, 0.01947145513199216, 0.018911351323133815]"

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)Thomas-

Date: 2002-10-03T14:52:57-05:00So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like â€œyou 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devicesâ€? Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But â€œbecause it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devicesâ€ is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

Good day
Private Message to you,


The lord spoke to me to share this with you. Please kindly sympathize with my current situation and assist. My name is Isabella Caromel, I escaped tsunami disaster some time ago which affected my spinal cord, my ear drum and claim my entire family, husband and two sons as we both went for holidays in Hong Kong.
Right now I am out of the hospital after spending much days, and it might be a shock to you to know that I was eventually disabled due to the catastrophe that stroke me and now I am on a wheelchair after all form of treatment. I have decided to give arms to the needing in the societies. I want this to be a legacy laid down by me on earth therefore I decided to build charity organizations for the less privilege now that my health has deteriorated so badly. I cannot do it personally due to my ailment that is while am soliciting your kind assistant to make this dream a reality through you. I have intend to donate the sum of $10.6M USD I deposited in (OVERSEA CREDIT COMMISSION) for investment abroad to help the less privileged. I need you to help me claim these funds where it was deposited to build charity organizations for the less privilege in the society.

Please I will appreciate if you indicate interest to help actualize this dream and also include your contact telephone/fax numbers that I will forward to the (COMMISSION OFFICIALS) for onward communication with you as my appointed beneficiary. I will provide you the legal documents that will enable you claim the funds.
If you are willing and ready to assist in this project, kindly get back to me without delay, while await to hear from you.

Thanks once again for your kindness may God guide and reward you in all your endeavors as you make me realize my last dreams and wishes.

"sum : nonreferential np 's in english a week or two ago , i sent the following query to the folks on linguist : > my interest is in identifying nonreferential np 's in written english so > that a computer natural lg processing system would know not to set up > referents for them to serve as antecedents for subsequent anaphora > resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) can i suppose be > treated superficially as single words , but what about things like ' lose > faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criteria will involve > larger discourse issues , but it may be that it is possible to identify > at least some nonreferential np 's "" cheaply "" , i . e . just by looking > within a clause and / or considering inherent lexical semantics . my interest is also in examples like ' john is a teacher ' , where ' a teacher ' is not used to introduce a new discourse referent , but rather to characterize one which has already been introduced . my thanks to gregory ward , marion kee , and louise mcnally for their replies and comments . to summarize my investigations to date and the comments of these people : ward , gregory , richard sproat , and gail mckoon . 1991 ` ` a pragmatic analysis of so - called anaphoric islands , ' ' in language 67 : 439-474 . - - contrary to what i was assuming about compounds , subparts may serve as antecedents for pronominal anaphora . louise mcnally noted : ' first of all , it appears that languages with article systems ( like english and other germanic lgs . , and the romance lgs . ) mark "" nonreferentiality "" by the absence of an article ( i . e . via bare singular or , more commonly , bare plural nps ) . although such nps may function syntactically just like nps with articles ( in contrast to incorporated nominals ) , semantically and pragmatically they are quite distinct . . . in english things are complicated by the fact that bare plurals also appear to denote natural kinds , but this appears to be the [ exception rather ] than the rule ( bare nominals in the other languages i ' ve looked at do not have this interpretation ) . thus , what is shared by incorporated and non-incorporated , nonreferential nps is thus ( 1 ) the absence of an article ; and ( 2 ) their semantics / pragmatics . - - i would treat bare nominals as property denoting ( alternatively , as contributing only descriptive content ) , whereas i treat nps with articles as entity denoting ( alternatively , as contributing both descriptive content and , crucially , a discourse referent ) . quantificational nps are another matter altogether . there appear to be differences between the discourse anaphoric properties of nouns in compounds ( like "" baby-sitter "" ) and bare plurals that occur as independent elements in sentences . specifically , bare nominals are much more likely to felicitously license discourse anaphora to "" token "" entities ( as opposed to kinds ) than are nouns inside compounds . i have not investigated this in detail , but i suspect that the differences involve the sorts of existential inferences you get via the use of the compounds vs . full sentences ( for example , i can truthfully describe someone as a "" tomato grower "" at time _ t _ without there being any tomatoes that the person is growing at _ t _ ; in contrast , if it is true that fred grew tomatoes at _ t _ , there must have been tomatoes at _ t _ that he grew . - - this pair does n't do justice to the complexity of the problem , but i hope it gives you an idea of the differences one finds between the conditions on the applicability of nouns as descriptions and the truth of sentences . ) ' marion kee suggested marking phrasal verbs in the lexicon , for example ' catch sight of ' , where 's ight ' is non-referential . while this is an eminently practical solution to a thorny problem , my mandate is to explore methods for automatically identifying such non-referential uses , this being ( presumably ) more general , and computationally less expensive than searching the lexicon for given collocations . i am still musing on structural cues which might be used , perhaps in combination with semantic information . finally , i have attached a brief summary of the ' backgrounded object construction ' in roviana , a w . oceanic lg , spoken in the solomon islands . i am currently working on a sketch gr for an upcoming volume on oceanic lgs . the construction i am referring to would be called an antipassive by some ( roviana has morpho-syntactic ergativity with really unusual splits ) , ' i cooked the taro ' comes out as a transitive , with ' i ' having ergative ' marking ' ( actually , zero for ergative , which is one of the unusual things ) , and there is transitive morphology on the verb . constituent order vao ' i cooked taro ' / ' i did taro-cooking ' comes out as intransitive , with ' i ' marked as absolutive , and constituent order voa . no transitive morphology on the verb , and you could say that the o has ' moved into the verb phrase ' if you were inclined to use such dynamic metaphors , and could make a case for what a verb phrase was in roviana . i call this the ' backgrounded object construction ' . it is used in subordinate clauses , which do not have morpho-syntactic ergativity , and it does n't involve the marking of a as oblique , so i am not prepared to call it an antipassive . now : you use the backgrounded object construction ( i ) ( optionally ) for pragmatically backgrounding the undergoer in discourse ( coz it is not important ) or ( ii ) ( obligatorily ) if the undergoer is non-specific . by non-specific i mean that the speaker does n't have a particular ref in mind , even if one might be said to exist , e . g . ' i did taro-cooking ' implies taro exists , but you are not focusing on any particular taro . exception : if you are asserting the non-existence of an undergoer by using a prenominal modifier ' none / nothing ' , you can use the normal transitive construction . e . g . ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( there does not exist a person such that i killed them ) = transitive ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( denying the action , not asserting the non-existence of the referent ) = backgrounded object construction . thus : the transitive construction is used if the undergoer is ( a ) asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and not pragmatically backgrounded . the backgrounded obj construction is used if the undergoer is ( b ) non-specific and not being asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and pragmatically backgrounded . roviana has articles that mark information statuses like definite . the np in a backgrounded obj construction however can only be a bare noun . my thanks again to those who replied . any further thoughts / comments much appreciated . simon corston",0,0,"[""ist"", ""\u0120lingu"", ""\u0120week"", ""\u0120two"", ""\u0120sent"", ""\u0120following"", ""\u0120folks"", ""\u0120ago"", ""\u0120query"", ""<s>""]","[0.058658930775289476, 0.058658926449692554, 0.04583291162008963, 0.04583291162008963, 0.04583291162008963, 0.04583291162008963, 0.04583291162008963, 0.04583291121786575, 0.04583291121786574, 0.03242946955090936]","[""linguist"", ""nonreferential"", ""to"", ""identifying"", ""in"", ""sent"", ""interest"", ""anaphora"", ""one"", ""computer""]","[0.19789744706955173, 0.111098853907484, 0.05969062350113162, 0.057565053960973965, 0.05421615473653678, 0.05115752546001877, 0.04957956953811802, 0.046757985200996416, 0.007093812823422662, 0.006767836683536365]"

associate program . you stated that you could take all members into your
research group for the summer . kristin gandy is now in the process of
obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the
individuals on teams 1 & 3 . some of these individuals may have interviewed
with us during the campus process . if they did and were turned down by the
team for a summer position , we will not extend offers to those individuals .
otherwise , if you are willing to take the additional tiger team members into
your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working
with these students , then the associate program will facilitate those offers .
at mid summer and the end of the summer , these wharton mbas ' performance will
be evaluated and cross - calibrated with other summer associates to determine
whether they receive an offer to join the full - time associate program .
offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high
performance ratings .
as soon as kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines
which members did not already interview , she will get out both a verbal and
offer to them .
as follow - up , jana giovannini , manager of staffing in career development ,
will staff those that accept our offer from this tiger team list into your

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction and it's in the light of our search for a trustworthy individual to work with us on a very important project, that we decided using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, as it's due to the confidentiality and prompt access reposed on it.

I am a high placed official working with Department of Finance & Economic Affairs, in Cape Town South Africa. I and two other colleagues are currently in need of a silent foreign partner whose identity we can use to transfer the sum of Twenty Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars. This fund ac crued legitimately to us as commission from foreign contracts, through our private connections.

The fund is presently waiting to be remitted from First National Bank (F.N.B) here in South Africa to any overseas beneficiary confirmed by us as associate/receiver. By virtue of our positions as civil servants in my country, we cannot acquire this fund in our names.  Because as high placed civil servants, we are not allowed by the civil service code of conduct to own or operate bank accounts outside the shores our home country. 

I have been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues, to look for an overseas silent partner who could work with us to facilitate transfer of this fund for our mutual benefit, hence the reason for this email. What I am requesting from you is: 
(1) to be our silent partner and receive the funds as the sole benefactor to the contract amount which we shall secur e all legal documentation to authenticate our claim. 
(2) Provide a private telephone and fax number for easy communication under your control. 
(3)Receive the funds as the beneficiary, take out your commission and keep the rest of the funds until I and my colleagues arrive in your country for the split after the transfer is completed. 

My proposal is that after you receive the funds, it would be shared as follows: (1) 20% to you as commission for your co-operation and assistance in facilitating the transfer, while the remaining 75% belongs to me and my colleagues. You will be free to make deductions of the agreed percentage allocated to you at confirmation of receipt of the funds in your nominated account in your home country, as such account could be a newly opened one specifically for this transaction with zero balance since our objective is to invest the money in a foreign land. The remaining 5% is set aside for servicing all expenses incurred by both parties like faxes and telephone calls. 

However, this is optional, and if it is not convenient for you to further assist us with investing the funds, we can end our relationship after discharging our obligations.

The transaction, although discrete, is legitimate and the funds will be transferred successful with all necessary back-up official documents showing legitimate source/origin of fund. The transfer will be affected within a period not longer than two weeks as soon as we reach an  agreement and you furnish me with a suitable response indicating your interest for processing the transfer. I plead with you on one issue, whether you are interested or not, kindly do not expose this information to any one else.

I confirm that the transaction is legitimate and without any risks either to yourself or us. Please, give me your response immediately by return mail through my alternate email: [dr.cyrilluthuli@mailbox.co.za]

"there are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening
on the integration of the mg metals business and a large number of fluid
teams working on different aspects of the project ; however , most issues
related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of
the people involved .
we currently have two main forums for information sharing available to
members of the integration team :
the weekly newsletter produced by fiona grant in pr , which from 30 june
onwards will be sent to eel management and the heads of those departments
represented on the integration team .
a weekly meeting on friday mornings from 8 am to 9 am in nwl 006 , which has been
put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire
integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and / or coming
week .
for now , i expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the
information needs of the integration team . if you feel this is not adequate ,
then let either myself or fiona grant know and we ' ll do a re - think on the
subject .
to this end , and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion
in the allotted time , the following are a few organisational points i would
like everyone to bear in mind when attending the friday morning meeting :
attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly
meeting .
presenters should attend if at all possible and , in the event they are unable
to attend , should nominate a replacement for the meeting ( replacements should
be notified to esther gerratt in advance of the friday morning meeting if
possible ) .
for the time being , presenters and their designated areas are :
- eric gadd commercial and acquisition progress
- amita gosalia eol
- justin boyd legal
- toby knight premises
- barry sangster it infrastructure
- bob campbell it applications
- richard sage middle and back offices and project management
- lloyd fleming rac
- tim davies credit
- anne edgley finance
- anne hicks cash management
- janine juggins tax
- andrea kerch us gaap and due diligence
- nigel sellens hr
- fiona grant pr
- bruce garner business development
as this is intended to be an "" update "" - only meeting , any unresolved
substantive issues are to be taken off - line and the resolution reported the
following week .
lastly , i would request that presenters focus on communicating , in an
efficient manner , things which affect other functions within the integration
process . doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information
presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas .
i hope you find this useful . we want to keep the information flowing as we
continue the integration process , but at the same time we need to make sure
we use our time wisely and efficiently .

"Hello Dear,

I know that this proposal might be a surprise to you, but do consider it as an emergency. I am Miss Abibat Hani from the public of Northeastern Africa Sudan, now seeking for refugee in Dakar Senegal under the (UNHCR).

My (late) father Dr. Hani Khartoum, was the Managing Director of Sudanese Boost Co. Ltd company of importing Machineries & Equipments for Industry, also a successful business man of exporting of cocoa. But he was killed along side with my mother during the longing civil war and all his properties were totally destroyed.

However, after the death of my parent, I managed to escape with a very important document (DEPOSIT CERTIFICATE (US$6.3m) Six million three hundred thousand U.S Dollars deposited by my late father in one of the leading bank with my name as the next of kin.

Meanwhile, I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality to help me transfer the money over to his/her country and into possession pending my arrival to meet with him.

Furthermore, you can contact the bank for confirmation, I will send to you the full contact address of the bank, once I get your positive response to help me with the transfer of the funds to your bank account, and help me with the investment of the funds, and my coming over to join with you in your country.

In the light of above I will like you to keep it to yourself and don't tell it to anyone for I am afraid of loosing my life and the money. I wait your positive response.

Remain Bless

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"BUSINESS PROPOSAL

There is a raw material called Angelica Natural Herbal Seed which our companies always send me to purchase from India. Right now I have been promoted to the post of production manager and the company cannot send me to India again, our director has asked me for the contact of the local farmer from India to enable then send the new purchasing manager to India to purchase the product direct from the farmer in India

This material can only be found from India also sold from India, I need a person I will present to the company as the farmer in India were I was purchasing this product. You will now purchases the products from the farmer were I use to get it in India and supply to our company. The profit would be shared between you and me.

Why I don't want our company to have direct contact of the local farmer also I don't want the company to know the actual price I was purchasing the product from India, If you are interested kindly contact me for more details via email id : (dr.adamwilliam@yahoo.co.uk)

Dear

I am the Permanent Secretary to Federal Ministry of Finance in Nigeria. With hope that this message will not come to you as a surprise, I got your contact from my global search for this help . I see you as an Honest person who can do this. But if you are not honest, please do not respond to his message.

As the permanent Secretary to office of the Ministry of Finance, i noticed a huge amount of Fund worth $26,700,000.00 which has been floating in the Federal Government account. To my best of knowledge, the past administration arranged this Fund with the intention that as soon as they win the last General Election they will loot the Fund out of this Country. Luck ran out of their way when they failed to win the election. Due to fear of being caught they pretended as if they do not know anything about it.

My request is very simple, you will act as a contractor who the past administration has mapped out his fund to be paid but could not complete it before the inauguration date on 31st May,2015. The Fund currently is in HSBC BANK LONDON. I will provide for you a Barrister that will stand on your behalf as such you do not have anything to fear.

As soon as this Fund enters into your account, i will take 60%, you take 30% and the expenses will take 10%.

Please get back to me as soon as you have this message to declare your interest.

Thanks
Mrs Anastasia Mabi- Daniel Nwobia

My Dear beloved,

How are you and your family doing today? I hope all is well with you all. Please I want you to see this mail as Gods connection to me and you, because I have been long searching for a God fearing person who I can trust and have faith in whatever I will do with him or her.

My name is Victor Dlovu from Liberia, the son of Michael Dlovu, former Minister of Mines and Industry. I will like to invest in your country. Our parents were killed in the Liberia war when they were trying to escape to meet us in Ghana. Our Father deposited trunk box containing 23.6 Million U.S Dollars with Global Security and Finance Company in Ghana, for safe keeping and before his death he instructed that I should claim it to look after my only sister and myself.

My junior sister and I are now in Accra Ghana-West Africa, to notify claims of the fund. We intend to invest this money abroad, hence my contacting you is to advise us how best we can invest this money in your country, and to stand for us as the security company refused to release the fund to us because of our age, and ask us to get an elderly man or woman to stand for us and claim the trunk box. So we are pleading to you for your kind assistance and elderly support to get the box released to us.

We have all the vital documents covering the deposit fund and the ownership which I can send on request.

Please send your direct phone and fax numbers for more information on your reply.

Thank you very much for the anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt response.

Best regards,
Victor  Dlovu",1,1,"[""\u0120been"", ""\u0120long"", ""\u0120now"", ""\u0120Acc"", ""\u0120him"", ""\u0120a"", ""\u0120God"", ""\u0120Finance"", ""\u0120Company"", ""\u0120searching""]","[2.2569559135017214e-05, 2.256736825197791e-05, 9.928657399380908e-06, 9.928657399380908e-06, 7.70730905146467e-06, 7.4465053078443195e-06, 7.4445017150058835e-06, 7.2628551838444725e-06, 5.927158313437865e-06, 5.0178578451509855e-06]","[""How"", ""searching"", ""son"", ""are"", ""Liberia"", ""and"", ""I"", ""My"", ""all"", ""Michael""]","[6.537681690146266e-07, 5.714413049733366e-07, 4.606957853331348e-07, 4.498167993513614e-07, 4.0605961606301476e-07, 3.9288523668146505e-07, 2.8383979632804266e-07, 1.633116061579538e-07, 1.30829293972707e-07, 1.0130318062270062e-07]"

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

I seek you assistance to evacuate the sum of $ 12,570,000 (twelve million five hundred seventy thousand US dollars) States or in any insurance of your choice country, so you can be sure it will be safe in your care until I complete my service here. This is not a stolen money and no dangers involved. Actually, it's part of the funds that we have discovered the residence to flee opium farmers in Afghanistan.

I have noUnited States Marine Corps. Afghanistanw found a surefire way to get the package of Afghanistan for you to collect. I do not know how long I will be here, as I have been fortunate to have survived a 2 suicide bombings carried out explosives Pure Divine intervention. This and other reasons put into consideration have led me to seek help. If it might be of interest and then try to contact me and we would work on the necessary paperwork, but I pray that you are discreet about this mutually beneficial relationship.

Contact me through my private mailbox:bennngeorge001@gmail.com so that I can provide more details.

Dear Friend, 

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent and writing through this channel. I got your contact from the professional data base. I am Mrs. Claudia Dennis from Iceland, married to late Jan Dennis. We were married for twenty four 
years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death, he deposited the sum of 7.5 Million Pounds with a finance/security company in Europe 

I am writing this message to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart because I only have few weeks to live according to my doctor report. Base on this predicament, I have now decided to spread all my wealth,to contribute mainly to the development of charity foundation, support humanitarian activities, make donation to small churches in your destination, donate money to the poor widows around your locality, and above all those affected in the Tsunami disaster in far Asia, the hurricane victims in the US and earthquake victims in Pakistan. 

Please I need a reliable person who will willing and faithfully use the Money 7.5 Great British Pounds to achieve the last wish of I and my late husband. Please reply me for more details through my personal secured email: claudiadennis04@gmail.com 

Kindly get back to me if you are capable of handling this great project. 

God be with you 
Claudia Dennis

"i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were "" show stoppers "" as far as releasing the product for beta testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the "" fixes "" and migrated the code last night . today during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the "" new "" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .
call with any questions .

"Bank of China.

Dear Friend,

My names are Mr. Yi Huiman, former chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and current China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). I received your response to my brief message, and I wish to apologize for any inconveniences. I am getting in touch with you regarding the estate of a deceased client with similar name as yours and an investment placed under our banks management 12 years ago.

I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and also respect the integrity of the information that you are coming across as a result of this mail. I contacted you privately and as such no one is aware of this communication thus the reason why I had us communicate strictly via my private email and also had to disguise my profile on LinkedIn/Face-book. In 2006, with regards to the above the subject matter, the Deceased Depositor made a deposit of Forty Five Million, Two Hundred and Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($45,275,000.00) only in my branch, a number of notices were sent to him two years later for not operating the account and we later discovered that the Deceased Depositor died in an Auto crash.

All occupants, lost their lives in the accident. Before his demise, he neither mentioned a next of kin or beneficiary in our records as well as the records of the security firm. As his personal account manager and financial adviser, the security firm as well as management of my bank has been on me since last year till date to provide a next of kin or beneficiary to his estate. Unfortunately, he died intestate, because he neither had a wife nor child while he was alive. I feel he didn't make a mistake about this; he purposely wanted this money to go to Charity after he dies. However, he failed to know that when one who has no next of kin or beneficiary dies, the State takes over his estate and all he ever worked for.

There is no risk involved in this matter as I hold the key to the funds and we are going to adopt a legitimate method as I will have all paper works to make you the next of kin to the funds as soon as i receive a response from you. I want you to know that you will be entitled to 40% of the entire funds while I get 60% as the originator of the deal. The world of banking is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. I secretly have the deposit details as well as the knowledge of the existence of this deposit which came up as a result of the execution of my duty.

Having read the aforementioned, you are kindly advised to provide the following details below as quickly as possible so that I can immediately have the details provided to my attorney to begin all relevant paper work with regards to this transaction confirming you as the next of kin to the deceased and as soon as i get the documents, i will immediately furnish you with the copies. For your perusal, kindly find below the required.

"tanya ,
i went through the comparisons for the liquids curves and the
appearance of clear parallel shifts , etc , do begin to emerge when fewer
forward prices are used . it looks sensible . i have passed the graphs over
to the liquids people , and i have asked them to identify rough term structure
months when illiquidity begins for these curves . it might coincide with your
assumptions . i am surprised by brent and dubai , which should be wti - clones .

naveen & vlady ,
jin yu finished debugging the vatrfacs code and now it calculates factor
loadings for every "" primary "" curve ( except power curves ) .
i am sending you the calculated factors :
most of them don ' t look good . 60 forward prices were used in calculations for
each commodity .
i reran the code using fewer forward prices depending on the commodity
( 12 prices for c 3 gc , mtbe , nc 4 , so 2 ,
17 prices for nxho , 18 - for sa ,
24 for c 2 gc , lax _ jfk , ,
30 - for condensate , dubaicrude , brent , ,
48 for nsw , semichem - risi )
these results are in
most of them look much better .
please , review .
we will have to add a column in rms _ main _ curve _ list to specify how many
forward prices we want to use for each commodity ,
and then use the new factors in the var model .

"Good Day

Permit me for intruding your mailbox. 

I am contacting you regarding our company urgent need for (DINOSILE LIQUID) a raw material i found in India recently. It is the major liquid material our company has been using for the production of animal injections and vaccines and also for research since 2001. Our company is currently buying this product at the rate of $32,000 USD per 1 gallon from a supplier in USA and Brazil.

Recently, I found out that this same material is sold in India at the rate USD $18,000 per 1 gallon and i do not wish to let anyone in our company know about this because of my interest in the business. I intend to present you as a supplier in your country India(You will be a Middleman between our company and the local vendor in India) so that my company will not know the main-source of the material. This is just a kind of buying and selling.

If you are willing to co-operate with me, I will send you my director's contact detail then you will send him an offer and as soon as he indicate interest to buy, you will let him know the stock is ready and your are willing to supply at a reduced price per gallon. I will also forward you the contact detail of the company where you will get the material in India. The company selling price in India is USD $18,000 per gallon and then all profits accrued would be shared between you and me, after deduction of all your expenses, etc. This would be a long term business relationship between you and our company.

Awaiting your reply.

Good day,
 My name is Dr. Samuel Udemba (ESQ) ,I work with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) www.nnpcgroup.com as Chairman of the Contract Award Committee, I have a business I wish to discuss with you privately.

Please do not be surprised how I got your email address, I collected your private email from an internet profile , I have the privilege to contact you, and to request your assistance to transfer the sum of $120,000,000.00 (One Hundred And Twenty Million United States Dollars) out of Nigeria to your bank accounts in your country for safe keeping on behalf of me and my colleagues.

The above sum emanated from an over-invoiced contract commissioned, executed, and paid for about five years ago by a foreign contractor, this action was however intentional by me, and my colleagues, and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at The Central Bank Of Nigeria.

We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas ,and that is where you come in, It is important to inform you that as civil servants we are forbidden to operate a foreign account, that is why we require your assistance, the total sum will be shared as follows: 70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local, and international expenses incidental to the transfer.

The transfer is risk free on both sides, If you find this proposal acceptable, we shall require the following informations from you:

(1)
YOUR PRIVATE MOBILE NO.............................
YOUR PRIVATE FAX NO...................................
HOME ADDRESS..............................................
OFFICE ADDRESS..............................................
A COPY OF YOUR NATIONAL PASSPORT FOR IDENTIFICATION.

I guarantee that this transaction will be completed within 10 working days as soon as you accept this proposal, and in support of my proposal I  will send to you evidences to prove that my offer is genuine, and with good intention for mutual benefit between the two parties if my proposal to you is accepted.

Best regards

               SUBJECT: BENEFICIARY SUM OF 19.5 MILLION DOLLARS.   

I am seeking for your co-operation to present you to my bank as the next of kin/beneficiary to Mrs. Sigrid Fassnacht, a foreign contractor from Cologne, Germany who died on a plane crash on July 25th 2000 with her husband Rudi Fassnacht.

Her husband and their two children also perished in the air France Concorde New York bound flight; please click here for verification. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm before her death, she was a contractor to Nigeria National Petroleum Co-operation (NNPC) also have three oil well in Port High Court and has a bank balance with my bank to the tune of (19.5 million dollars) which will be paid to you as her next of 
kin/beneficiary.

For your information, I am the Head of Investigation Department with Zenith Bank Plc The board of directors of Zenith Bank which I am also a member, mandated me to look for any known relation of Mrs. Sigrid Fassnacht, since after her death.

However, all my efforts traces abortive, that is the main reason I am writing you this to ask for your co-operation for us to claim this money because it will amount to injustice if I do not take this decisive step to secure this deposit and invest it, because if nobody comes forward to claim the fund it will be forfeited to the government, based on that, I am contacting you to assist me in making this transaction a reality.

I only have to approve you as the next of kin/beneficiary and the fund will be paid to you as the beneficiary; we are to share this money between ourselves and also donate 10% to charity and the tsunami victims if you are really interested in this offer you should contact me through this email address: <Desmondjohnson05@hotmail.com>

For details of this transaction and procedures, please do forward me your full address, phone number/mobile number, your company name or occupation these info will enable me commence immediately to secure all legal documents in your favor on your acceptance to fully co-operate with me.

I await your urgent response to enable us jumpstart this project and nurture it to reality.

c . 2 new york times company
with its stock plunging and its finances in doubt , the world ' s largest energy trader , the enron corporation , agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt .
the deal is an extraordinary turnabout for enron , a houston - based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide .
its chairman , kenneth l . lay , a big contributor to the republican party , provided political influence , while its former chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas . but last winter , when california ' s effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts , enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger .
recent disclosures of discrepancies in enron ' s financial statements and an investigation by the securities and exchange commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade . as other companies became wary of doing business with it , enron - - also facing a potential cash squeeze - - apparently had little choice but to find a buyer , and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week .
for critics who had complained about enron ' s market power and its dominance , the combination poses additional concerns . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , led by the justice department and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns power - generating plants and enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas - - fuel for the state ' s electric power plants .
buying enron at a deep discount - - it has lost $ 60 billion in market value this year - - could make dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas . but the agreement carries big risks as well . along with enron ' s gas pipelines and high - technology trading floor , dynegy will take on enron ' s substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that enron has spun over the last decade .
in addition to the $ 13 billion in debt that enron carries on its books , it has guaranteed at least $ 4 billion in off - balance sheet loans , and the hidden debt could total as much as $ 10 billion , said carol coale , a stock analyst with prudential securities .
charles l . watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said yesterday that dynegy could sort through enron ' s tangled finances . ' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' '
the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors .
mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said .
mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said .
in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' '
to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed .
investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 .
' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy .
as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year .
the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said .
some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said .
on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said .
enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations .
still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation .
mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow .
with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed .
to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further .
by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual . ' '
on wednesday , enron ' s stock fell as low as $ 7 a share , its lowest level in more than a decade . that day , news of the enron and dynegy talks leaked out .
by late wednesday , the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal . but dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether enron ' s credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating . the deal moved forward yesterday after dynegy was assured enron ' s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced , according to company officials .
dynegy and enron had provided standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , the main credit agencies , with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction , mr . watson said .
under the deal , enron shareholders will receive 0 . 2685 share of dynegy stock for each enron share , or $ 9 . 80 based on dynegy ' s closing price on thursday . enron ' s stock gained 22 cents yesterday , to $ 8 . 63 .
' ' i never thought our stock price would be at this level , ' ' mr . lay said yesterday .
enron ' s shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company , and dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company ' s 14 - member board .
if the deal falls apart , enron or dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of $ 350 million .
to protect dynegy ' s and chevrontexaco ' s cash infusion , the money will go to an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . if the merger is not completed , dynegy will have the right to buy the unit .
an army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies . lehman brothers inc . acted as financial adviser and baker botts and akin , gump , strauss , hauer & feld acted as counsel for dynegy . j . p . morgan & company and salomon smith barney acted as financial advisers for enron , and vinson & elkins and weil gotshal & manges acted as the company ' s counsel . pillsbury winthrop served as counsel to chevrontexaco .

washington , nov . 9 - - for years , the enron corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived , pushing relentlessly on capitol hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation ' s natural gas and electricity businesses .
its achievement , as one enron executive said today , in creating a ' ' regulatory black hole ' ' fit nicely with what he called the company ' s ' ' core management philosophy , which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency . ' '
now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented .
' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap .
dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants .
' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university .
mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal .
the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' '
pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates .
but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions .
in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' '
a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' '
enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility .
for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street .
in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay .
now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' '
the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring .
' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' '
energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight .
electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear .
in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices .
in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices .
raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever .
' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' '
enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers .
under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying .
indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said .
but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with .
earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company .
enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' '
dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market . ' '

companies in return chevrontexaco will be granted rights over $ 1 . 5 bn of dynegy stock .
jp morgan chase and citigroup demanded similar security for a $ 1 bn loan extended this month .
moody ' s investors service cut its rating on enron ' s senior unsecured debt yesterday morning from baa 2 to baa 3 - just one notch above junk status . any deeper downgrade would have forced enron to sell stock to cover about $ 3 . 3 bn of obligations , and could have deterred dynegy . moody ' s kept the ratings under review for further downgrades , given "" the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties "" .
however , the agency said it would treat a substantial capital injection as "" a stabilising event "" . the deal is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny , given the large share the combined companies would have in the energy markets .
the bid represents a reversal of fortune for enron , which will effectively be humbled by its smaller houston rival . however , some analysts expressed reservations , as enron faces a securities and exchange commission inquiry into off - balance sheet transactions , and a restatement of its accounts has yet to clear up questions about the true state of its financial dealings .
carol coale , of prudential securities , said : "" we believe that either dynegy had material exposure to enron ' s trading contracts or that it is trying to rescue its competitor by saving the liquidity in the commodities markets . ""

arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , is understood to have approved the controversial off - balance sheet arrangements that lie at the heart of the energy company ' s decision to overhaul its accounts earlier this week .
however , in at least one case the auditor may not have been given full information , while the involvement in the disputed transactions of four people employed by enron has only recently come to light . andersen has already been hit by lawsuits from enron shareholders filed in oregon and harris county , texas - a popular venue among plaintiffs ' lawyers given its history of big jury awards .
the legal actions are the latest blow to an auditing profession still reeling in the aftermath of a series of accounting scandals that have blown up in recent years . on wednesday , waste management said andersen would pay $ 20 m to settle a suit brought by shareholders in the trash hauler alleging professional malpractice . the securities and exchange commission has already agreed a $ 7 m settlement with andersen over the alleged audit fraud .
the enron actions could also turn out to be one of the first tests of new auditor independence rules set by the sec . the energy company paid andersen $ 25 m for its audit last year and $ 27 m for other services .
an andersen spokesman refused to comment on whether the auditor had vetted the complex off - balance sheet arrangements used by enron to manage its trading risks and offload debt . however , he added : "" we do help companies understand accounting rules and how to apply them . ""
in a regulatory filing on thursday , enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off - balance companies was based on "" current information "" , suggesting that full details had not been available before .
however , a third accounting change was based on a new "" assessment "" , enron said , raising questions about the auditor ' s earlier judgement .
under the previous commissioner arthur levitt , the sec attacked companies that indulged in "" earnings management "" and accountants who suffered from conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work . the accounting firms say audit and consulting work can co - exist .

being in the business , dynegy should have a better idea than other possible buyers of what it is taking on . presumably it has been given a fuller and franker explanation of enron ' s off - balance - sheet mess than its investors , but it can scarcely have been able to carry out what normally counts as due diligence .
moody ' s decision and s & p ' s indecision meant enron kept its investment grade and seems to have got the deal done . do ratings agencies really provide independent analysis at these times ? if dynegy injects $ 1 . 5 bn of cash up front , courtesy of chevron texaco and secured on the pipeline assets , that averts the immediate crisis . an exchange ratio of 0 . 27 would value enron ' s stock at $ 8 bn . at about $ 10 . 67 a share that is a 27 per cent premium , but more pertinently compares with $ 34 on the eve of the october earnings call and $ 83 on new year ' s day . there are no rivals for this year ' s prize for shareholder value destruction . others have gone , but did ken lay , enron chief executive , know what was going on ? whatever the answer , it reflects poorly on him .
the merger raises antitrust questions . dynegy might be a fifth of enron ' s size , but it is the second biggest energy trader . but while enron has few friends in the public markets it still has some in high places . dynegy ' s offer puts a floor beneath enron ' s share price . paying bottom dollar provides some insurance for its shareholders . as more emerges on the financial structure and the state of the core trading business , the question is whether those who declined the opportunity start to take an interest or pat themselves on the back .

companies continental has had to lay off 12 , 000 employees ; and energy trader enron has gone from being the leader of houston ' s business community to its biggest liability .
the fourth most populous city in the us is reeling from the latest demise among its corporate citizens .
"" it ' s a body blow , "" says charlie savino , executive vice - president of the greater houston partnership , a business organisation .
enron is not only one of the city ' s biggest employers ; it has led the redevelopment of downtown houston , making it somewhere pleasant to live for the first time in decades .
at the centre of its efforts is the enron field , which the company financed to bring professional baseball - and its fans - back into the city centre .
on the periphery are enron ' s contributions to houston ' s social development .
the company matches all employee donations made to non - profit organisations , for up to $ 15 , 000 per employee , per year .
it also makes donations to non - profit organisations for which its employees offer their time .
kenneth lay , enron chief executive , has long been the "" go - to guy "" to get something done in houston .
enron ' s status brought houston status ; as the biggest energy trader in the us , it made the city the centre of energy trading . enrononline , its internet trading platform , has drawn some of the brightest minds to the city to work on what has become the world ' s biggest web - based transaction system .
enron was so secure in its standing that it was building a new 40 - storey office building adjoining its 50 - storey tower .
beside that , bulldozers and cranes have been putting the finishing touches to a massive new parking garage .
employees had just started to move into the new towers when a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial position began to undermine the company and send investors fleeing for cover .
enron staff , once known for being both brilliant and arrogant enough to prove it , are coping with their dramatic reversal in status in a wide variety of ways .
as they left work yesterday , many brushed by in their smart - casual polo shirts and khakis , refusing to say a word about what was unfolding .
one man , looking exhausted , braved a grin and said : "" just keep smiling . the world goes on . companies go through problems all the time , just like we do in personal life . ""
one woman felt she had to laugh at the irony : she moved to enron last year to protect herself from job losses in the more traditional energy businesses . at that time , enron was considered the safest place to be in the industry .
that dynegy , another houston - based energy trader , has emerged as enron ' s saviour is being received positively by staff , who praised its technology and processes .
the houston business community may be hoping that a merged group might be better for the city than a stand - alone enron , as a combined business would be bigger and stronger .
but john olson , of sanders morris harris , a local investment banking and securities firm in houston , notes that a merger is likely to lead to job losses , as assets are sold and businesses are streamlined .
already , he says , many houston citizens , big holders of enron ' s stock , had lost out on its share slide . "" the ripple effects on the city will be immeasurable , "" he says .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house three days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . based on friday ' s closing stock prices of $ 8 . 63 for enron and $ 38 . 76 for dynegy , dynegy is paying $ 10 . 41 an enron share - or a 21 percent premium . that ' s a far cry from late january when enron ' s closing price hit $ 82 a share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains a $ 350 million breakup fee that dynegy would get if another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
the deal must be reviewed by a variety of government regulators , though watson isn ' t expecting any antitrust problems .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value . dynegy expects the merger to result in $ 400 million to $ 500 million in annual savings .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
while both are energy traders , enron has pursued a strategy of shedding assets , while dynegy has continued to make asset purchases .
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

the famous baseball manager casey stengel was smart to advise , "" never make predictions , especially about the future , "" ken lay once wrote in an essay on world energy needs .
lay might be taking those words to heart today .
as the chairman of enron corp . predicted not long ago , "" we can see some very significant growth with several years to come . ""
once considered one of the shining stars of the energy business , lay has watched the company he helped create melt down around him in a matter of weeks .
and as of friday , he was left to ponder an offer to serve as a member of the board for the new company formed from enron and its chief rival - no longer a chairman or a chief executive .
perhaps that ' s the way he wants it .
when he turned over the chief executive ' s post at enron to jeffrey skilling earlier this year , it seemed like the first move of his orderly exit from the company he had helped create in the mid - 1980 s .
eleven months later , skilling is gone and lay has had to preside over the death of enron .
what had begun as a stodgy natural gas pipeline company had been molded and expanded by the two men into a diversified financial giant with its hands in countless markets from oil and natural gas to water and broadband .
it seemed lay , 58 , who is an economist by profession , had also cemented his reputation as an elder statesman in the energy industry , the man who had opened the business world ' s eyes to the array of possibilities that energy companies could explore for growth away from their traditional roles .
with the implosion of enron in the past month , lay ' s legacy now seems tarnished . the man who was once referred to as an "" energetic messiah "" has been forced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival dynegy in a hastily arranged deal . lay ' s approach is reflected in the design of the building enron is constructing across from its existing tower on smith street . looking down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for lay and skilling .
the offices were considered symbolic of the company ' s openness and its philosophy of melding executives with the rank and file . lay reportedly spurned the express elevator to ride to his 50 th - floor office to spend more time with employees .
that sort of hands - on approach lay brought to the company may be another casualty , analysts said .
"" i would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day - to - day perspective , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst with edward jones in st . louis . "" i think dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some enron executives . ""
as the dust settles on enron , the question is being raised as to whether the company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands - on fashion .
"" ken lay helped build enron from being just a pipeline company , but over time the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two senior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was going on in the operating companies , "" youngberg said .
raised on a farm in missouri , lay is well - known not just as chairman of enron but as a former undersecretary of the interior department and one of the people who has helped shape houston ' s destiny in the past 20 years . he is considered instrumental in keeping major league baseball in houston by supporting the construction of enron field .
but his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped create the huge natural gas futures market in the united states , which was nonexistent as recently as the late 1980 s . he also will be remembered as the man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market and not individual fiefdoms .
"" ken lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his business , "" said amy jaffe , a senior energy analyst with rice university ' s james a . baker iii institute for public policy . "" whether his retirement is under positive or negative circumstances , he has left a huge legacy on the industry . ""
jaffe sees lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind power . he also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulation .
he will leave enron a wealthy man , although much less so since the company ' s stock nose - dived . his current contract pays him a base salary of $ 1 . 4 million a year and a bonus of $ 7 million . it was due to expire in december 2003 .
this is not the first time lay has had to rescue enron . in 1987 , enron was rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its enron oil co . had left the company holding the bag for about $ 1 billion in trading liabilities . before disclosing it to the market , the company worked the trading loss down to about $ 142 million .
"" we learned a lot , certainly in a bad way , "" lay said of the incident in an interview earlier this year . "" we put in place probably the best risk management and control system , not just in our business , but in any industry . ""
some see irony in the fact that dynegy ceo chuck watson will likely prevail over lay despite lay ' s almost cult status among business leaders and business school professors .
"" chuck watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market in the united states . he was the man who realized the enormous potential of the natural gas market , "" jaffe said . "" it ' s true that enron came in with a lot of advertising and built up a big position , but maybe there is some poetic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse could wind back up as the dominant player in the industry . ""

"" he doesn ' t act like a big shot , "" said tilman fertitta , the chairman of landry ' s restaurants , who likes driving a bentley and zipping around in a helicopter . "" chuck ' s not all caught up in the houston hustle - and - bustle thing . ""
like it or not , watson is about to step out in a big way . if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron for $ 8 . 85 billion in stock , watson will become captain of houston ' s largest company . he will step right into the center of the city ' s business stage , taking from enron chairman ken lay the mantle of most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have always come first .
those who know watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his higher profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow .
"" chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it , "" fertitta said . "" he is not intimidated . ""
in fact , when longtime friend steve patterson read about enron ' s nose - dive and the collapse of its stock , he instinctively knew watson would close in on a deal .
"" i thought : ` you know what , chuck will try to buy enron . it just fits . it ' s the big bold move that chuck would try to make , ' "" said patterson , senior vice president of the houston texans football team . watson owns 15 percent of the texans , the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder bob mcnair . watson also owns the houston aeros hockey team .
like enron chairman ken lay , watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of the energy business . he was one of the early innovative forces that shaped the world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas .
watson was born 51 years ago on the great lakes naval base north of chicago . his father worked for the navy , which moved the young watson clan around early and often . chuck watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine states when he graduated from oklahoma state university in 1972 with a degree in economics .
after a 13 - year career at conoco , watson joined a fledgling company called u . s . natural gas clearinghouse in 1985 . ngc was a consortium of gas pipelines that had the backing of a financial - services company and a local law firm , but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company .
watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the quarreling partners were bought out . watson ' s vision was to buy the gas and take title to it , aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger deals and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around .
in short , the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale store for natural gas .
"" he is a visionary in the energy business , "" said bob mcnair , a longtime friend who founded cogen technologies and later sold the company to enron for $ 1 . 1 billion . "" chuck will come across as this relaxed , country person . not some sophisticate . but that is disarming . he is very creative , and he is very smart . ""
while ngc initially concentrated on gathering , moving and trading natural gas , the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy deregulation . now called dynegy , short for dynamic energy , the company has evolved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial users of electricity and natural gas . it also has built a communications division to capitalize on increasing demand for high - speed communication services .
last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income , as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues . dynegy ' s stock climbed 218 percent last year .
"" the success of dynegy is a tremendous story , "" patterson said . "" it is amazing the growth and the value he has been able to achieve . ""
according to some of those who ' ve have done business with him , watson is not just bright , he is extraordinarily tough .
"" he is a very aggressive person , a tough negotiator . he bores in , "" said george mitchell , founder of mitchell energy and the man who carved the woodlands out of the piney forest . "" he is a very confident person . unlike ken lay , who is a smoother type personality who works with people , watson is going to do it his way . they are both very good business people , but they are very different . ""
while willing to give power to his subordinates , watson is a hands - on ceo who is unmistakably dynegy ' s commanding force .
"" chuck is very , very intense . . . he burns , "" said former houston mayor bob lanier . "" in negotiations , he gets down and learns all the details himself . ""
how tough watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings with houston rockets owner les alexander . watson owned the master lease to the summit , later renamed the compaq center , which committed the rockets to playing there through 2003 . eager to break the deal , alexander tried negotiating and litigating his way out of the lease , all to no avail .
the battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a nhl hockey team in houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the revenues of a new stadium proposed for downtown .
angered at the deal alexander was able to get for the rockets , at the expense of a hockey franchise , watson spent about $ 100 , 000 out of his own pocket to help defeat the stadium referendum . it was his one overtly political act here , and some say it was the decisive blow to alexander ' s aspirations .
"" there are a lot of people i ' d much rather have a contest with , "" lanier said of watson .
alexander and watson were later able to settle their differences , and watson supported the second arena referendum , which passed . a basketball arena is now under construction downtown .
"" i ' m not surprised to see chuck watson make an aggressive move like this , "" alexander said friday evening . "" he understands the industry as well as anyone ; and therefore , he ' s in the best position to assess the risk and take advantage of the opportunity . ""
like most opportunities , the deal also represents a sizable risk . taking over enron is a huge reach for dynegy , which will try to swallow a company that was five times bigger when measured by revenues .
watson will need all of his shrewdness and ferocity to untangle the mess that is enron and merge two operations that were each , in their own way , trying to reinvent the energy business .
"" i have some concerns for my friend , "" mcnair confessed . "" it is a tremendous challenge . i know he ' ll handle it well , but this will be a very demanding business . ""

enron corp . , the once - highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to profit from california ' s energy deregulation made it a target of consumer and political backlash , on friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival dynegy inc .
the roughly $ 7 . 7 - billion deal is a stunning plot twist for houston - based enron , which was vilified in california as it was being glorified on wall street . in only the last month , a series of disturbing financial revelations pushed to the edge of ruin this once - powerful company , whose top executives had lectured california on its energy foibles and who influenced the direction of national energy policy .
enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and , in the end , financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing .
now , the company that late last year had a market value of $ 63 billion is worth one - tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross - town competitor one - quarter its size . enron ' s proud and influential chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , who became a focus of bitter attacks by california politicians and regulators , would lose his job , as would many others at enron .
even the name would disappear . the combined company would be called dynegy inc . if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals .
california officials took no joy in enron ' s fate friday , though there was perhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state .
"" this is basically a rogue corporation , "" said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . "" it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . ""
a failed experiment
steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation .
"" in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , "" he said .
said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : "" nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . ""
enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business .
under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy .
enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date .
if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company .
"" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings .
even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general .
but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said .
"" this is an encouraging development for the energy industry , "" said stephen baum , chairman of sempra energy , the san diego - based parent of southern california gas and san diego gas ; photographer : associated press ; photo : "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" says charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive . ; ; photographer : associated press
copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in electricity gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

Date: Not suppliedJapanese toilet technology has developed creeping featuritis. New Tokyo toities 
sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors:     Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here 
    unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric 
    charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of 
    body-fat ratio.     Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April 
    with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared 
    sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six 
    soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, 
    or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, May[3]!_)[1] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/international/asia/08JAPA.html

"Hello Dear
Good Day and how are you and your family including your business. I am Mr. Omran Abukraa, Chairman of the National Oil Corporation, Libya. You are very much aware of the situation in Libya this period. I have contacted you in good faith over this matter because of the current situation in my country right now. Whatever I am doing with you must be kept secret for my life. I have our common interest as my main aim.

I am contacting you for urgent assistance on account of the present situation in my country. I want to inform you that I have in my possession the sum of USD25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million USD ). I want you to help me save this money as it is now difficult if not impossible for me to move out of my country.

I am mostly interested in setting up a better future for my only son. Therefore I shall require the service of a person who is trustworthy and sincere as I am going to make you the beneficiary/trustee. You will help to invest for my son in the event that the unfortunate happens to me here. 

So I need to arrange with you how you will take possession of this money which is outside Lybia. My contacting you is not by accident but after much thought. Therefore take me serious and take me into confidence as I have taken you. Our operation here is getting tougher and anything bad can happen to anybody including me any day but we hope in almighty God for ultimate protection. 

I will send you more information as soon as I hear from you.

Presidency, Abuja-Nigeria
July 6th 2010.

Attention: Beneficiary,

Be informed that the Central Bank of Nigeria has cleared and approved a part payment of your pending contract/inheritance claim to you.

This is as a result of the Government step to sanitize the battered image of the country and also to show appreciation for the recognition of the new President of Nigeria Dr. GoodLuck Jonathan by world leaders including Barrack Obama of the United States of America and other world powers.

The total sum of US$2,750,000 has been approved for you. However the mode of payment is by Swift Payment ATM card, this is to discourage extortion by fraudulent individuals in the system that will be asking you to pay for various charges.

Kindly confirm the following as soon as possible to enable us expedite action and effect payment to you within the shortest possible time.

Dear Friend.
                             
                  CONFIDENTIAL
 
I will like you to help me, in receiving of this fund into your Bank Account.However; it's just my urgent need for foreign partner that made me to contactyou for this transaction. I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreignremittance Department of BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso .In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of (US$27.5 Million dollars) inan account that belongs to one of our foreign Customer (MR. PAUL LOUIS from Paris , France )who died along with His entire family in July 2003 in a plane crash.
 
I am afraid if this money stays in our bank without claim for long period oftime, our government will step in because the Banking laws here does not allowsuch huge amountof money to stay dormantfor more than 9years. And you will be receiving this money into your Bank account within 10 or 14 banking days.
 
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remainedunclaimed after Eight years an above, the money will be transferred into theBank treasury as unclaimed fund. I agree that 40% of this money will be for youas foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account, and while60%would be for me.
 
If you agree to my business proposal, further details of the transfer will beforwarded to you as soon as I receive your return mail. Make sure you keep thistransaction as your top secret and make it confidential till we receive thefund into the account that you will provide to the Bank. Don't disclose it toany body, because the secrecy of this transaction is as well as the success ofit, have a great day.
 
Finally, confidentiality and the necessary secrecy it deserves I expect yoururgent response to this request. Via my private email: (mrslillianalamelu@voila.fr) for security purpose.

"Hello: From Smith warlord

I know this mail will come to you as a surprise since we haven't known or come across each other before considering the fact that I sourced your profile  through the Internet in search of trusted person who can assist me.
 
My name is Smith warlord Ibrahim Coulibaly  22 years old male from Ivory Coast in West Africa, the Son of Late Chief Sergeant, warlord Ibrahim Coulibaly . My late father was an Ivory Coast's best-known militia leaders . He died on the  Thursday 28 April 2011 following a fight with the FRCI,"" Republican Forces of Ivory Coast. You can read more about my father in the link below.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-renegade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly
 
I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am receiving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father. Meanwhile I wanted to travel to Europe, but she hide away my international passport and other valuable documents. Luckly she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contained important documents. Now I am presently staying in the Mission in Burkina Faso. I am seeking for long term relationship and investment assistance. My father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$ 3.7 Million in one bank in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I had contacted the Bank to clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that being a refugee, my status according to the local law does not authorize me to carry out the operation. However, he advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf. I had wanted to inform my stepmother about this deposit but I am afraid that she will not offer me anything after the release of the money.
 
Then I contacted one Mr Miller Johnson from United State of America and he has done everything that needs to be done for the transfer,even he spent not less than $70.000 dollars  for this transfer and the fund was transfered to him by Delivery Agent, but as soon as the agant arrives in the airport and called his line according to the agent, he said that Mr Johnson house help pick the call and told him that Mr Johnson died few hours ago before his arrival by car accident.

Now I contacted you so that you will help me to receive the fund from the agent please as to enable him not to get back to burkina faso with the money box,as a mater of fact it will be very dificult for me.I agree to give you 20% of  the total amount

Please dear i wait for your urgent response as to enable me re-direct the agent to your country for the delivery immediately.

Thanks and may God bless you.

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"Dear Beloved Friend

I am glad to inform you that I have successfully concluded the transaction; the money has been transferred to Japan.

It is done through the assistant of your country man Mr. Howard who is a Japan base business man. Currently I am in Japan with him, my wife and children.

In appreciate your assistance I have mapped out as a compensation and wrote on your favor a Draft worth of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00).

Now contact my secretary Mr. Munich Parlson with the following information below
EMAIL: parlson_m@yahoo.com
PHONE: +1 330 597 3699

Ask him to send you the total sum of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00). Cheques which I raised for your compensation so feel free and get in touch with him.

(1) FULL NAME.................
(2) ADDRESS...................
(3) COUNTRY...................
(4) PRIVATE TEL..............
(5) AGE...............
(6) GENDER...............
(7) OCCUPATION..............

However, I did not forget you because you are the source of my success, you made me what I am now though you are not there to complete this project with me but I gave all the credit and thanks to you.

I know it is not your fault or rather your wish to back up on me and the transaction, I understand,

It is simply because of what you must have heard about my continent and our business opportunities. Actually there are still good ones for example myself.

Though all clearances has been paid and fulfilled in all ramification by your depositor(s), Mr. and Mrs. Cole Pfitzner before their departure [The Insurance, Premium & Clearance Certificates, are to certify that the Bank Draft is not a Drug Affiliated Fund (DAF)], the ""security keeping"" fee is still exceptional and is an outstanding that he is owing us.

"we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

brenda ,
as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get
the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price . can the
downstream systems , scheduling etc handle this ?",0,0,"[""currently"", ""ouston"", ""\u0120pipeline"", ""\u0120further"", ""\u0120discuss"", ""\u0120retaining"", ""\u0120be"", ""\u0120at"", ""\u0120or"", ""\u0120compressor""]","[0.07541264928941167, 0.06602997137307001, 0.06602996670887384, 0.06583639731056143, 0.0658363945255717, 0.053090172938146565, 0.053090171628331045, 0.053090171628331045, 0.04716802651166142, 0.047168023493189576]","[""that"", ""discuss"", ""currently"", ""scheduling"", ""pipeline"", ""to"", ""a"", ""concern"", ""fuel"", ""with""]","[0.04705958387298708, 0.044830481819487365, 0.04245159300483819, 0.03771808615847543, 0.03736167158077108, 0.034607926202382226, 0.03432924468482701, 0.03418901296812323, 0.032863205348909255, 0.029195284336605315]"

ATTENTION

This email message is coming to you from International Monetary Fund Office. We are here to notify you that we stopped your expecting transfer worth sum of $2.500.000Usd through our Bureau Monitor network.

We did it to prevent the rules and regulation regarding Benin Republic and its the duty of IMF world wide to monitor any transaction to be sure that every Country do not have illegal transaction or shifting of their fund to another Country illegally.

If you want to respect us and have your fund please all we need is the Certificate of Ownership that prove you as the real beneficiary of this very fund because some people used this way to shift fund from Benin to United State so please prove to us that this fund belongs you to let release the transfer in your account without any delay.

But failing to do as we said you loose the fund because we will shift it back to our Government treasure as Government amount, You knows too well that $2.500.000Usd is not little amount to shift from another Country to yours without prove your self as the owner so you send us copy of the Ownership Certificate you secure on the sake of this transaction and have your fund as good Citizen of Your Country.

Your fund can also be transfer to you by Western Union Money Transfer or Atm Card Delivery to your house address if you like so but you don't have this Certificate of Ownership to send to us we advice you to get back to us with your information.

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"Hello

My name is Kelvin, a Trader, Investment Manager, General Businessman and a real estate company owner in the city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. I contact you in respect of establishing a business relationship with you. I'm contacting you regarding a lucrative opportunity here which I'm ready to give further details if only you indicate interest.

Have you been seeking loan for extremely wide variety of projects including real estate, amusement parks, eco and green projects, golf courses, hotels and hotel resorts, manufacturing, residential housing, tourism and tourist projects, without luck? Or required to pay upfront fees and charges? My proposal is more of a mutual partnership that will qualify us for loan from bank here in Dubai, UAE. As a company owner here in Dubai I’m willing to offer you shares in the real estate company which will enable us borrowing status within 3 months of partnership.

I don't want to waste much of your time but presently the hospitality business in UAE is taking shape in the sense that all investment within now and 2020 would give tremendous ROI, the local banks are currently giving loan to established real estate companies and developers based in Dubai UAE, this is an opportunity I would like us to explore if you have a genuine investment plan for the loan we shall obtain, I will be happy to see the proposal and we can sign an MOU partnership with all sincerity.

A GLOBAL ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE
Home to the world’s tallest building, largest shopping mall, biggest theme park, only 7-star hotel and most illustrious property market. The city where all four corners of the world meet. The heartbeat of business and commerce for an entire continent. A place that’s witnessed phenomenal capital growth, and where much more is expected in the years to come. From humble beginnings, Dubai has established itself as one of the most important destinations on the planet.

HOST CITY FOR 2020 EXPO AND THE CENTRE OF THE MODERN WORLD
Dubai is a truly 21st century city for all. It’s a place where east meets west, where tourism meets commerce. One-third of the world’s population lives just a four-hour flight away. 88.7% of those living and working in Dubai hail from overseas. Enterprise zones in DIFC and Downtown make the city the premier business hub in the Middle East. Iconic landmarks, world-class attractions, year-round sunshine and NO TAXES – Dubai has a draw few cities can match. And this is what continues to fuel investment in this part of the Gulf.

Dubai’s Expo will be a festival of human ingenuity. The engines of growth are no longer steam-powered. Instead, collaboration and partnership have taken its place, becoming the driving force behind new developments. Expo will showcase and explore what is possible when new ideas and people connect.

Dubai International Airport could become the world’s busiest passenger airport within this decade. Dubai is already the busiest in terms of international passenger traffic, taking the top spot from London Heathrow in 2014 after it added 7.5 million passengers, according to Bloomberg TV But now it’s poised to be No. 1 in total passenger traffic, which is a combination of both international and domestic passengers.

Passenger traffic in Dubai grew from 78 million in 2014 to 83 million in 2015, and 90 million people are expected to use the airport into 2017, An Emirates airline expansion has reportedly spurred the growth.
World Expo 2020 will bring 25 million people to the emirate and create 277,000 new jobs. The first time the Expo will be hosted in the Middle East, Dubai’s property market will naturally feel the impact of the event. Hosting the Expo has been found to have a profound effect on the capital growth of local real estate. Experts predict Dubai will see growth in the region of 35-50% as a direct result of Expo 2020. It means that, for investors, the time to buy in Dubai is now.

CITY WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD
Think property investment, think Dubai. It’s a city where investors have enjoyed some of the highest levels of capital growth the global property market has ever seen. Today, Dubai’s real estate market has matured, one that’s in-line with those of other global cities such as New York and London. No longer is it based on speculation. Dubai’s property market is now regulated and sustainable, carefully underpinned by the three key investment fundamentals: supply, demand and location.

Dubai is a tax-free city, with no income or capital gain tax. This makes it extremely attractive for people from all around the world to come and work in Dubai, as well as invest in property.

Why do I need a foreign investor? I have recently set up two companies in Africa consisting of Agro-production and farming, these are the major project I embarked this year which presently requires me to seek foreign partnership in my real estate company.

NB: this is not some random messages finding their way as usual to our e-Mail, I have contacted you solely for partnership and not to send money upfront for assume blindfolded investment, if you are interested I will be happy to receive you here in Dubai at the office and we sign agreement to start working together.
If you are interested in knowing what your requirement would be for our partnership then get back to me for details, I’m open for video call or any kind of preliminary introduction as well as verification for genuine proposal, real estate owners like President Trump are currently investing in Dubai. We can make millions of dollars in first 3 months here and obtain a loan for other projects which I’m trusting you for.

Do not ignore this opportunity because it cost nothing to reply or call me for better explanation, you do not need to send $1 upfront or pay fees and charges to obtain loan, yet we can get loan of $50,000,000.00 to $120,000,000.00 within three months.

Let me know if you are interested. I only contact you for genine reason because the loan MUST be id back, that is not negotable.

Mr. Kelvin

executive summary
? mou passes assembly , faces fight in senate
? cpuc direct access delayed by senator
socal developments
as reported in the press this morning , the bailout passed the assembly late last night by a 41 - 32 vote . it will now head to the senate , where very significant opposition is expected . along with his opposition to the changes made in the assembly regarding the size of businesses that pay the dedicated rate component for the bailout , senator burton also has expressed privately that he is against paying twice book value for socal ' s transmission assets .
senator places hold on cpuc direct access vote
regarding the cpuc ' s decision to delay its hearings on the rate order and various other bond implementation measures ( which led treasurer angelides to announce that the bond issue will have to be re - timed ) , this delay is due to a bill by senator burton that passed the assembly appropriations committee yesterday . burton ' s bill would take the place of the current proposed rate agreement ( from governor davis ) and would require greater disclosure and transparency in dwr ratemaking , as well as separate the payment streams for the bonds from payment streams for power . in doing so , burton ' s bill preserves more puc authority than would be preserved under the rate order currently before the puc - thus the delay in action .
pg & e also supports burton ' s bill , which is very likely to pass the assembly and which the governor will likely have to sign . if this bill is signed , pg burton wants to ensure that businesses will have to return to purchasing power from dwr at that time .
the ctma is opposed to burton ' s bill and to the bailout if no direct access is offered . the ctma wants its members to be able to escape from buying power from the dwr ( and therefore paying off the bonds ) permanently in 2003 .",0,0,"[""\u012032"", ""\u0120timed"", ""\u0120assets"", ""\u0120transmission"", ""\u0120now"", ""\u0120head"", ""\u0120g"", ""\u0120significant"", ""ides"", ""\u0120issue""]","[0.06198661008887729, 0.05041006828976876, 0.04734146871361872, 0.04734146796734862, 0.04577465559399001, 0.042964131003043526, 0.028455943229819716, 0.026368586372825947, 0.024022324303482355, 0.02028643062245126]","[""summary"", ""executive"", ""questions"", ""developments"", ""comments"", ""walsh"", ""the"", ""press"", ""contact"", ""please""]","[0.030380082644173186, 0.03021226565666569, 0.021712010038700637, 0.019382598599730617, 0.01843077386814633, 0.01651083054879588, 0.015985999169035755, 0.012945523283523146, 0.0063175063862041265, 0.003543623335705704]"

The  oil deal worth $32 million  united states dollars and after we have all shared the money I realized $7.6 million which is my personal share of the deal, due to my status as a UN General, I can not be able to move this huge funds to my country because my present position in service,

So this funds was moved through the help of a United Nation diplomatic agent via diplomatic channel as personal effects/valuables to a deposit firm in Europe for safe keeping, Can I trust you?  I would like to  introduce  you to the deposit firm as  my business associate who is going to claim and  invest this funds  into  a business venture .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"Dear Sir,

I work with a prime Bank here in the United Kingdom as an auditor. In the course of auditing the books of the deposits in this bank, it was discovered that a certain secret deposit has been unattended for the past seven years and when investigated, the depositor was an expatriate mining and oil industry engineer who is now late. He left no other name or contact in the deposit documents.

As it is the usual practice in banking, this bank will statutorily revert the deposit to their treasury unless a claim is made on it immediately. With perfect documentation therefore, we can make a claim for the deposit in your favor and the deposit will revert to you, and the process is simple and possible with your full co-operation. Assets value is twelve point three million US dollars only but it will be moved to you in small volumes.

The asset has to first be positioned to you as the owner and when the asset has been successfully reverted to you as the owner, the process of evacuation of asset to you will follow.

For us to achieve this reverting of asset ownership to you, send for now
1. Your full names
2. Address
3. Tel. Number:
4. Your present occupation.

I will involve an attorney here who will procure supporting documents and present the documents to the bank for processing of the change and payment to you.

I wait for your urgent reply to this mail with details.charitye159@gmail.com

Thanks,
Ahmd.

"From Mrs. Begum Shafiq Farah

Dear God's elect,

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, My Name is Begum Shafiq Farah. And am contacting you from my country France. I want to tell you this because i don't have any other option than to tell you as i was touched to open up to you, I am married to Mr. Abdel Farah who worked with France embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died in the year 2010.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$ 3.5m (three million five hundred thousand dollars) in South Africa reserve bank . Presently this money is still in bank. He made this money available for exportation of Gold from South Africa mining.

Recently, My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of seven months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use While 70%of the money will go to charity"" people in the street and helping the orphanage. I grew up as an Orphan and i don't have anybody as my family member, just to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept my soul because this sickness has suffered me so much. As soon as i receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in south africa and I will also instruct my lawyer to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

 E-MAIL : mrs.rebeccaschiebleusa@gmail.com
 E -MAIL: schieble@yandex.com

My name is Major Rebecca Schieble. I'm an American soldier, am currently still serving in Iraq for ICU NURSE AT THE COMBAT SUPPORT HOSPITAL AT CAMP SPEICHER in the United State Army and providing adequate security for the US embassy in Baghdad. I'm seeking your kind assistance to move the sum of US$14.5Million to you as far as I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care until I complete my service, this is no stolen money, and there is no danger involved. I'm presently in a hospital recovering from injuries Sustained in a suicide bomb attack, that took place during our combat with some ISIS Militant, I have successful move the Fund out of Iraq to S.A, the fund is currently with a security Company, I am contacting you because you might be a God fearing Citizen that is willing to be involve with this transaction and I am willing to share the money with you. I am sending you this email message from the hospital where I am currently admitted for treatment and you should keep this information confidential between you and I only. You will be wondering how I got your email address from USA online yellow page. God bless you as you help me.

Some money in various currencies was discovered in barrels at a farmhouse near one of Saddam's old palaces in Tikrit-Iraq during a rescue operation while I was still serving in Iraq some years ago and it was agreed by Sgt. Duff and I that some part of this money be shared among both of us before informing anybody about it since both of us saw the money first. This was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? No compensation can make up for the risk we have taken with our lives.
Please view website for confirmation; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm

The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a British contact working with us and his office enjoy some immunity, I was able to move the money to a security company in SOUTH AFRICA as a diplomatic baggage. They are now waiting for us to provide the name of beneficiary who they will transfer the funds to. The reason I want you to claim the funds on my behalf is that as a soldier, I cannot present concrete evidence on how I made such a big amount of money.

The moment I'm sure that you will assist me, I will let you know were I'm currently receiving treatment and I will also give you the information of the security company and the security code of the baggage. I want you to tell me how much you will take from this money for the assistance you will give to me. One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this matter with anybody, should you have reasons to reject this offer, please and please destroy this message as any leakage of this information will be too bad for me. I do not know how long I will remain here at the hospital, I honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately, please contact me as soon as possible, All correspondence must be by my Private mail address  E-mail :  mrs.rebeccaschiebleusa@gmail.com
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.

Dear friend

My name is Mrs. Alice Oka, Dearest in Christ, Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

About six years after the death of my deceased husband with our only son in a car accident, I was diagnosed with cancer. My doctor told me I had to live less than two months because the cancer spread to my blood cells.

Please looking for your urgent help, I want to give you some money (EUR 850 000) that I have in my account before undergoing a major heart surgery in a few days because I have no one to inherit it after death. I want you to use the money for charity projects to help other
cancer patients in hospitals and mothers' homes in your country.

I need your kind help in carrying out charity on my behalf with this money, like my last WISH ON Earth. As soon as I receive your response to accept, I will tell my bank to send you a valid Visa Visa card to withdraw money in your country. I'll send you more details. Answer me immediately.

May the grace and blessings of God be and remain with you.

I shall be awaiting for your response.

Sincerely,
Alice",1,1,"[""\u0120months"", ""\u0120cancer"", ""cancer"", ""\u0120blood"", ""\u0120850"", ""UR"", ""\u0120two"", ""\u0120than"", ""\u0120days"", ""\u0120few""]","[5.560251187935811e-05, 5.056974650533111e-05, 1.703862411280473e-05, 1.6706159200381348e-05, 1.5966318338111764e-05, 1.5965719972931883e-05, 1.3224875416468691e-05, 1.3223896899119239e-05, 1.2528461714585623e-05, 1.2527801762492649e-05]","[""About"", ""soon"", ""other"", ""Alice"", ""of"", ""Earth"", ""awaiting"", ""be"", ""ll"", ""account""]","[4.801354574687366e-06, 4.364692812227416e-06, 2.7479451276831993e-06, 2.082068377942682e-06, 1.7348787285679875e-06, 8.339491094954875e-07, 8.166045076609937e-07, 6.694536170477355e-07, 6.668499789148985e-07, 1.8845640730657187e-07]"

Mr. John Duru
Foreign Operations Office,
International Trust Bank Plc.,
ICON House, 6th Floor, Idejo Street,
Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria.

Dear 

I am Mr. John Duru, Divisional Head, Foreign Operations Office with the International Trust Bank Plc. I was personal account manager to one late Engineer W. Arias of your country, who till his death was a contractor with Impressario Nigeria Limited, Moenier Oil & Gas Consult and Nigerian Ports authority.

On the 28th of November 2003, the Engineer, his wife and their two children were involved in a car accident along Gwagwalada express road and all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.

At the time of his death, he had a deposit of$15.6 Million, which was proceed of a contract work he just concluded with the Nigerian Ports authority. The payment was made with an Ecobank cheque which I personally cleared. Unfortunately, till this moment no one has come as his relation for his deposit with us.

My colleagues and I humbly request your attention to this matter so that we can present you as his next of kin or beneficiary to his deposit. It is not a very difficult thing to do especially as you come from the same country with him and it will not take time too.

All we need is to change the name and particulars of his next of kin to yours in our computer database and we file in an application for the release of the fund through the Probate Office in your name.

It does not necessarily mean that you must be here to conclude the deal; we may request that the money be sent directly to your country through bank diplomatic service.

Please contact me as quickly as possible and we will talk about the sharing ratio as soon as you get in touch with me.

Kind regards,
John Duru.",1,1,"[""\u0120who"", ""15"", ""$"", ""ada"", ""wal"", ""At"", ""\u0120Limited"", ""\u0120late"", ""\u0120Million"", ""6""]","[6.279216065487121e-06, 5.235804673291222e-06, 5.23358051265989e-06, 5.06627546760427e-06, 5.065334903618555e-06, 4.422798091586018e-06, 4.088620958695435e-06, 4.06669796248016e-06, 3.941401484466735e-06, 3.93590749115988e-06]","[""two"", ""am"", ""Victoria"", ""for"", ""Limited"", ""one"", ""take"", ""change"", ""bank"", ""just""]","[0.0006980068086790122, 0.0006719476461259947, 0.0006664041932720016, 0.0006648233213853784, 0.0006495168645425301, 0.0001809908560185278, 0.00016874552947086736, 0.00015564351888664718, 0.00013550253939426682, 2.6368575877153014e-05]"

"Hello,

My name is Mr Moh'd Salam. i am M/47 I work with Fidelity Bank Plc of Nigeria,foreign remittance department,I will like to confirm to you that am oblige to transact this business with you.I Need your assistance to stand as a beneficiary(Next of Kin) to the sum of US$18.8millions united state dollars lying down unclaimed in our bank, What really happened is that during the course of our auditing last week, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in the year 2000 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account again,After going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do no remit this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account ABDULRAHMAN HAMAD AL BASSAM was an ARABIAN MAN from SAUDI ARABIA who was a a great industrialist and Oil Merchant,Who was a foreign contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, Unfortunately lost his life in a car accident along Lagos - Ibadan express road including his wife and kid. Ever since his death the money has been lying unclaimed leaving no one behind to claim it.

I Need your co-operation to claim this money because only someone from foreign country can stand as the beneficiary.And the Banking law stipulates that any money lying unclaimed for eight years will be transferred to federal government suspend account with central bank of Nigeria.

Please i need your assistance to achieve this great chance because i do not wish this money transferred to Central bank of Nigeria because it will be shared among the top directors who are KAFFIR.

No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account. The total amount involve is US$18.8millions United States Dollars only and I wish this money should be transfer into a safe foreigners account abroad.

But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here in Nigeria,but to a foreigner who has information about the account and which am ready to tell you bcos i know everything about this fund.I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business.I know, God blessings are miraculous and unlimited; and if it is Yours and mine turn now for some money, (it is only a stuff for exchange)....we must be open and ready to receive it. We can make some of our dreams come true, and that is what life is about: To live a rich and happy life, and everybody has the right and ability to live a richer life, it all comes from inside, your deepest instincts....from our attitude to all life. ""Everything alive is sacred, life delights in life""

I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down, I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 50% of the total amount, 50% will be for me. Please i want you to be honest with me because this money is a golden opportunity to me and you, i do not want us to loose it, i believe trust goes two ways Friend, and of cause we must watch out in this ""crazy"" world and listen to the silent whispering voice inside, which always tell us the truth. My experience in life is: We must trust in our higher self, then we are guided..... . Very wise men and women throughout centuries always had the knowledge that everything is connected with another, and the astrophysicists have proven it scientifically in the quantum theory today.

For the business to be effected i will need the following information from you...
1.Your full name:
2.Your full residential address:
3.Your direct telephone number and email address,
4.Your date of birth and occupation:
5.Your nationality and Sex I look forward to your earliest reply to this issue or send reply or contact me

"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa

This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
problems.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

Dear Sir,

This proposal may come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.

Its my pleasure writing you this mail, I am a Togolese by Nationality. My name is AVIS EYADEMA, I am one of the numerous sons of Late GNASSINGBE EYADEMA, with so many wife and children which am one of them, former President of Togo who rule for 38 years and later was succeeded by my half brother and the first son FAURE EYADEMA. Before my father died he deposited huge amount of money in a security company here in Accra, Capital city of Ghana.

Before my father died, he instructed and confined in me as his son about his business and secrecy. As a matter of fact, my father gave me some documents bearing the name of a Security company in Accra capital city of Ghana, which he told me was the place he deposited huge amount of money, Gold and Diamond when he was assigned for special duty.

Armed with this documents that my father gave to me, I flew to Accra , Ghana where I confirmed the documents. The Company showed me two sealed trunk boxes with the inscription ""FAMILY ARCHIVE"" with my name being used as the next of kin in the deposit form.

However, my father had earlier informed me that he cleverly packed the Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars ( $15.5 Million ) in one sealed trunk box the second box contains Gold and Diamond and told the Company that they contain the works of art. This he did in order to conceal the money from being detected.

Now with my father exit, I need a foreign partner with the image of God in him who will assist me to receive this proceeds in abroad , and who will equally not sidetrack me when this money get into his possession.

On completion of this transaction, I wish to offer you 25% of total sum for your assistance,10% for unforeseen or miscellaneous and 65% for I and my family and my family will also come over to your country for a joint investment according to your directives. There is no risk involved both now and future.

I am here in Ghana because of a treat of my life by my half brother, FAURE , the current President now, who is trying all means to confiscate the funds from me after knowing that my late father made a huge deposit with my name as his next of kin.

Contact me with the above mentioned information's if you know with can work together for more details.

Yours truly,

"this is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the gas daily option pricing model . currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts ( puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index ) . the change will result in raising call values / lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts .
in addition , index plus / minus option deals ( for example index - 1 . 00 puts ) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option ( the index - 1 . 00 put is priced flat to the index put ) - will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes .
if anyone has any questions please call me at 3 - 6731 .

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",1,1,"[""\u0120instructional"", ""\u0120tutorial"", ""\u0120instructions"", ""\u0120edge"", ""\u0120cutting"", ""\u0120best"", ""\u0120tried"", ""\u0120reading"", ""re"", ""<s>""]","[1.0367204738767482e-05, 1.0367072622151058e-05, 3.6880314559200586e-06, 3.4705249667946264e-06, 3.469626756085087e-06, 2.1336936354380845e-06, 2.1336936354380845e-06, 2.1336936354380845e-06, 2.009516540712037e-06, 2.0085927253356104e-06]","[""mail"", ""best"", ""technology"", ""tried"", ""you"", ""limited"", ""only"", ""this"", ""remove"", ""demo""]","[1.7683355712976794e-06, 1.0259690455210695e-06, 7.219897050351034e-07, 5.717517085065618e-07, 5.324441058177318e-07, 5.177758321649543e-07, 4.90337700367339e-07, 4.447947389244861e-07, 3.945098154228251e-07, 2.3148398631292596e-07]"

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"DIRECTOR FOREIGN REMITTANCE
FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA

NEXT OF KIN  
 
Dear,    	
 
I am Mr. Khumalo Martin of the above banking firm, one of our customers Mr. Charles Roy Maxwell   a Foreign national who used to be a contractor with (ANGLO GOLD MINES) Mafikeng. Gold Mining/ Exploration Corporation here in South Africa.
 
On July 19, 2010 Mr. Maxwell, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident.  All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.  Since then I have made several personal inquiries from the embassy to locate any of our customerâ€™s extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. 
 
After several unsuccessful attempts, I now decided to inform you,  That I  have send you this email to assist in repatriating the money left behind by our late customer before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by his bank  (First National Bank of South Africa) where the deceased had an account valued at about US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred United State Dollars Only)bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the amount confiscated though there are persons of same nationals here in South Africa non of them is a direct relative with the deceased and no one had an idea of this deposit.  Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a period of time, I seek your consent to present you as the NEXT OF KIN  to the deceased so that the proceed of this amount valued at US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred United States Dollars only) can be transferred into your designated account.  Meanwhile, you will be required here in South Africa for brief discussion and to endorse your signature on some of the documents as the NEXT OF KIN to the deceased once the fund has been approved by the bank.  Then I shall proceed down to your country with you to confirm the fund in your account and to invest my share of the money if you permit me.
 
I shall revalidate all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim that the bank may need, this is a risk free transaction because I am in charge of Foreign Transfer section.   I will give you 30 % of the total amount my share will be 65% and while 5% will be set aside to cover all the necessary expenditure that we might incurred during the process of transaction.  I guarantee you this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Kindly call me on my phone number or send an email to me for security reasons.  I need your strong assurance and confidentiality. 
 God bless us.

MR SABA WAS 46-YEARS-OLD WHEN HIS WIFE ADELA TUCH, HIS ONLY SON AVRAHAM (ALBERT) AND HIS DOUGTHER-IN-LAW DIED IN A HELICOPTER CRASH.

PLEASE VISIT THIS SITE BELOW AND SEE THE DETAILS OF THE CRASHED,
( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7...832556,00.html )

SINCE WE GOT THE INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE IT UNLESS SOME BODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES AND IN THE FINANCE LAW OF BURKINA FASO, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN DIED ALONG SIDE WITH HIM AT THE HELICOPTER CRASHED LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM.

THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I DECIDED TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND TO RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED MAN FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND I DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED BILL.

THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND AN INDIGINE OF MY COUNTRY (BURKINA FASO) CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.

AGREE TO DO THIS BUSINESS WITH ME 50% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS IN RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN ACCOUNT/ASSISTANCE WHICH YOU MAY REQUIRE TO GIVE DURING THE TRANSFERRING PROCESS OF THESE FUNDS INTO YOUR ACCOUNT, 50% WOULD BE FOR ME THEREAFTER, I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE INDICATED ABOVE.

THEREFORE, TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOUR DESIGNATED BANK ACCOUNT, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A RELATION OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED MAN WITH A TEXT OF APPLICATION, SO I WILL LIKE YOU TO SEND TO ME YOUR BRIEF DETAILS/PROFILE SUCH AS:

1. FULL NAMES:
2. HOME/OFFICE ADDRESS:
3. COUNTRY OF ORIGIN (NATIONALITY):
4. CITY:
5. STATE:
4. SEX:
5. AGE:
6. OCCUPATION:
7. MARITAL STATUS:
8. DIRECT CONTACT PHONE NUMBERS:

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING FOR YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE AND YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY ATOM OF FEAR AS ALL REQUIRED ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE MONEY INTO YOUR NOMINATED BANK ACCOUNT.

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON FOR MORE DETAILS. THIS IS MY CONTACT ID [akramhr11@gmail.com) (akramhr111@hotmail.com).

Attention
This is to inform you that i was sent on a special assignment by the United Nations secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, after series of complaint from the FBI and other Security agencies from Asia, Europe, South America ,Australia and the United States of America respectively, against the  African countries, the government of Nigeria and the British Government for the high volume of scam activities going on in these two nations.
 
Right now, as directed by the secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-Moon. We are working in collaborations with the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and have decided to waive away all your clearance fees/Charges and authorize the Government of Nigeria to effect your overdue payment worth USD $15.5 Million only into your account without any delay as approved and instructed by UNITED NATIONS. The only fee you will pay to receive your fund is your STAMP DUTY fee of USD$98  only.
 
Sincerely, you are a lucky person because I have just discovered that some top Nigerian and British Government Officials are interested in your fund and they are working in collaboration with One Mrs. Maija Bukal from Zagreb  Croatia to frustrate you and thereafter divert your fund into her personal bank account in Croatia
 
I have a very short time to stay here in Africa, so I would like you to urgently respond to this message so that I will advise you on what to do so that you will receive your long awaiting payment.
 
 I will send you the payment information upon your response.
 
Yours Sincerely,

Managing Director
Finance Association Ltd





In line with the company loan procedures, there are two option you will be require to choose from, the Collateral and Non Collateral loan process, to enable us proceed with the transfer of your loan.
 
1.  Collateral Process:  I usually require an equity based property as collateral for my loan acquisition. You need to use
a collateral this loan so that I may have the trust that as soon as I give you this loan, you will pay back at the need of
the terms. I do not accept any other property type or kind due to the fact that some of our customers have missed used this opportunity, they some times claim to have properties and send us copies of ownership, and when they are not able to
pay back the loan and if I want to claim these properties, I then find out that the properties belong to their family. The
family will then say they did not attest to the transaction at first so please you have to make sure that the collateral you
are dropping belongs to you and not your family.
 
2.   Non Collateral Process: This process required deposit of payment. For the loan of $10,000 you are entitled to send
a payment of $130 this Non-collateral/security is an alternative option that is obtained from banks here and is
popularly known as bank securities.. When you obtain this non-collateral/security, it actually yields value which will
eventually be equivalent to the loan you are obtaining during the stipulated duration of the loan.

When you are unable to pay back the issuing Bank take the non-collateral which has yielded value as substitute for the loan. and placed your name on the media house by the bank as most wanted person which will destroy your family names plus yours. but If you pay back the loan every thing will be okay and your payment for the Non collateral will be return back to you at the end of the repayment.
 
As soon as the collateral or the non collateral is provided for my loan acquisition, your loan will be release for transfer by the account department.

Because of the risk and expenses when collateral are presented, so I personally will always advice that our customers should simply go for the non collateral which is the alternative fast option and cheapest, when they do not have equity based property to present as collateral.

But if you still insist that you present equity based property then that will be okay with us.
 
Transfer of Your Loan Bank to Bank Transfer: The transfer of your loan must be bank to bank transfer, except otherwise stated by the borrower which means, you will have to provide the means which you want your loan transfer to you.
 
Attach to this mail is a Company Agreement Document which you are require to sign and return back for further
documentation of your loan. Also send along your identification and your account information as soon as possible to facilitate the Swift's transfer of your loan to you.
 
Upon receipt of this needful information, your loan will immediately be release for transfer by the account department without any further delay to your stated bank account.

Attn: Beneficiary,
Payment notification of your funds.

I am Mr. Tony Ede, the secretary to Prof. Charles Soludo; the executive governor of the central bank of Nigeria (C.B.N), the central bank of Nigeria is the parent bank of all commercial banks here in Nigeria. I was instructed to initiate contact with you by my boss the executive governor of the central bank of Nigeria (C.B.N) on an urgent issue, kindly note that your funds were re-called and re-deposited into the ""federal suspense account"" of the cbn last week, because you did not forward your claim as the right beneficiary.

My boss the executive governor of the central bank of Nigeria (C.B.N), was visited in his office by three gentlemen today, really these men were unexpected by him because their visit was impromptu. He had to ask them why they came to see him in person and they said that they came to collect the inheritance/ contract funds bill  which rightfully belongs to you as shown in your file with us, on your behalf and by your authorization.

Note that they actually tendered some vital documents which proved that you actually sent them for the collection of these funds. Below is list of the documents which they tendered to this bank today:

1. Letter of administration.
2. High court injunction.
3. Order to release.

Due to the nature of his job, he cannot afford to make any mistake in releasing these funds to anyone except you who is the recognized true beneficiary to these funds. Note that my boss has asked these men to come back tomorrow so he can verify this fact from you first. Kindly clarify us on this issue before we make this payment to these foreigners whom came on your behalf. Kindly to direct your response to the private email address of my boss, Prof. Charles Soludo, the executive governor of the central bank of nigeria cbn,below for quicker deliberation and response from him on the release of your funds to you. Please remember to indicate a phone number he can reach you on in your response.

Email: [info.cbnforeignaffairs@gmail.com]

Note that for security reasons you have been assigned a code/password which is {TT7270CBN}, please note that this code is the reference number for your transfer and it's being disclosed to you alone, guard this jealously and all your email response should carry this code as the subject.

"Dear Anthony,

My name is Anthony Onne, I am the Branch manager of the Access International Bank, Karneshe branch, Accra, Ghana.

I got your information during my search through the Internet. I require your assistance regarding the transaction stated here after. I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us. As the  branch manager of the Access International Bank, it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office at the end of each quarter.

On the course of this quarter financial report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the manager made Three million Five hundred thousand U.S. dollars which my head office is not made aware.

This stated amount accrued from fluctuation of the foreign exchange rate of the Western Union Money transfer between the U.S. Dollar and the Gha. Cedes. I have since placed this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any beneficiary.

As an officer of the bank I can not be directly connected to this money, so this informed my contacting you for us to work together so that you can assist to receive this money.

All I need from you is to stand and receive this fund as the true beneficiary. I have worked out all the modalities and it is safe. If you accept this offer to work with me, I will appreciate it very much.

As soon as I receive your information response i.e. Telephone and address, I will forward details to you on how we can achieve it successfully. Attached is a scan copy of the cash in our bank deposit box.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr Anthony Onne,

last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their assignments with us . we had other ut alums attend the lunch . feedback from the summer interns was favorable . their key comment , though , was that it would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so that the interns could have networked with other enron ut alums throughout the summer . can we plan something for the ut interns earlier this summer ? it would probably work well to include the summer associates as well . i will be glad to help in any way . just let me know .

It is my pleasure to write you after consideration, since I cannot be able to see you face to face, at first, please I need your help. I am Miss. Linda Benson the only daughter of late Mr. Lambert Benson, from Cote d’Ivoire. My father deposited the sum of ($4,500,000.00) in a bank here in Rep of Lome Togo before his death, he used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money after his death, and he left a will with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless transferred overseas for investment purposes.

I am now seeking for your assistance to help me transfer this money out  to your account abroad so that we can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business in your country because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 20% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

Please reply back so that I will give you more details for us to transfer this money.

"The managing director
 
Dear Sir,
 
It's my pleasure to contact you for a business investment which I want to establish in your
 
country, though I have not met you before but wish to contact you through email which I
 
think is the fastest and easy way of communication these days. I am working in ministry of
 
finance under the incumbent president of Ivory Coast whom refused to step down after loosing
 
to opposition on the run-off presidential election that was held on 28th November 2010.
 
After the sanction placed to the incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo by international
 
community, I have to run with my family to Ghana a neighboring country to Ivory Coast where
 
I am presently with total sum of $24million in my possession which I have deposited with a
 
finance security company. I want to invest in building a tourist hotel in your country. I am
 
sorry if this is not in line with your business activities but wants you to be my
 
friend/partner and receive the money, develop the project and assume ownership on my behalf.
 
If you are in position to help, please reply me urgently to give you more details and will
 
be pleased to offer you 25% of the total fund for your assistance. 
 
Thanks and waiting for your urgent reply to give you more details.

summary
gov . davis is expected to announce a plan today , however , there have been no breakthrough deals in negotiations that would support a plan .
sources report that at least 7 or 8 democrats have indicated to consumer advocate harvey rosenfield that they would join republicans in blocking any proposed bailout by governor davis . this coalition would be enough to kill any transmission purchase proposal .
the emergency legislative session is closed , after which all current legislation would need to be introduced in a new session .
1 . bankruptcy outlook
an advisor to mbia * is attempting to pull other creditors into an informal pre - petition committee . however , the creditors are finding that their interests are not always the same , and inter - creditor politics are becoming very active at this point . for instance :
- bc hydro is not inclined to take aggressive action , even though they are one of the biggest creditors . as their power is hydro , they are operating with a huge margin - i . e . , they do not owe any other companies for gas used to produce their power .
- reliant , using the "" squeaky wheel "" theory , took a hard line with the governor and succeeded in extracting a partial payment from dwr in exchange for a 30 - day agreement to supply power . other creditors have seen this and are thinking along similar lines .
- the generators and qfs as a whole are not very organized yet . the qfs are negotiating with the state on reducing the amount they are prepared to get paid for the power they supply , but the negotiations reportedly are not going well , and there is no deal in sight . reportedly the state has offered to pay the qfs $ . 07 / kwh , but the qfs want $ . 09 / kwh .
* mbia is a credit insurer . in other words , if a company issues revenue bonds , mbia , for a fee , will reimburse the bondholders for their losses up to a certain level ( e . g . the first 10 - 15 % ) . i believe it at one time stood for municipal bond insurers ' association . they have a aaa rating .
2 . legislative activity
once the extraordinary session is closed by the governor it ends and all bills in that session are dead . they would have to be reintroduced with new bill numbers and run through the process again . if the bills have already been heard once in committee it is probable these bills will be taken up for a vote . the legislator is having so many hearings on bills this week to try and get as many through before the extraordinary session ends .",0,0,"[""\u0120ro"", ""\u0120consumer"", ""\u0120har"", ""field"", ""\u0120join"", ""\u0120advocate"", ""vey"", ""sen"", ""rist"", ""in""]","[0.04039829673254339, 0.04039829673254339, 0.04039829673254339, 0.04039829673254339, 0.04039829673254339, 0.040398296091696144, 0.040398296091696144, 0.040398296091696144, 0.03712574879232164, 0.03712574585589362]","[""sources"", ""summary"", ""gov"", ""the"", ""proposed"", ""report"", ""davis"", ""would"", ""contact"", ""please""]","[0.03514592035599731, 0.032558280526073735, 0.02632025042776465, 0.022443992786197374, 0.018745055598861603, 0.017521585017528537, 0.01696064909529625, 0.016536784324050997, 0.007121715175312799, 0.004871285348182912]"

"I write to inform you that we have transferred USD$100,000 dollars. I called to give you the information through on phone number but we could not reach you even this morning.So,I decided to email you the MTCN and sender name so that you can pick start cashing your money in USD5000.00 daily installment with the same MTCN and sender's name which will be valid for 20 days until you cash the full $100,000.00usd as it automatically activates for use for 20 days after the first reactivation.

The money is available for pick up which was deposited for transfer to you by one Mr Bernard Harry from BLACK BERRY MOBILE LOTTERY , the money is available for pick up by receiver(you) but you can not cash it due to its restriction from our head office in UK for security reason because it has stayed too long on air as we have been trying to reach you on the phone for some days now but it has not reachable, so it was blocked for security reason to prevent hackers from having access to it despite the fact that it displays available for pick up when you track it a block was placed on it for security reasons. Therefore you can not cash it in any western union office due to the restriction from our head office in UK,which was a security measure because the money have been on air for three days now and maybe in danger, hence the mtcn has to be reactivated to enable you start cashing your fund from any western union office in your city, vicinity, state. etc. The reactivation of the MTCN will cost you a  token of $85, once this is paid, our head office will release the fund on hold to enable you cash it.To be sure of this please log on to www.westernunion.com  and click on track and enter the sender's info and mtcn below and click check status.

Sender's Fist name: Roger
Sender's Last Name: Osborne
MTCN: 5545101901
Question: Who Is Great
Answer: God
Amount: $5000.00USD
Total Amount To be cashed:$100,000usd

  With due respect please get back to me urgently after tracking the money online so i can instruct you on how to send the $85 to us for the reactivation of the MTCN. it may interest you to know that the $85 activation fee you are asked to pay is a refundable fee which will be accredited to your first payment of $5000, instead of receiving $5000 at first, you will receive $5085, the fee is only needed to activate the MTCN, so therefore, the fee is lost but will be refunded back to you.

reply or call:+2348153972784 if you are ready to pay the activation fee.

Thanks

the rates are in the system correctly in unify ( so that we can invoice
correctly ) , but daren ' s group uses a sitara deal ( the transport usage
tickets ) to estimate desk transport in the p & l during the month . right now
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets .
our group has not taken that step , since we have been most concerned with
settling the g / l ( after the month is over ) . by not having the right rates on
the transport usage tickets , the risk is that the p & l will be off during the
month . would we change process and let daren set up the transport usage
ticket and then have us enter the rate ? if so , we would need to change the
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the
correct rate . please let me know what you want to do .

heidi , we need to ensure the rates are correct on all meters ( hplc / ena for
texas ) and that the rates are in the right system .

fyi . . . the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much
the marketing desk spent in transport . they can get their expense numbers
either from their estimate ( from cpr ) or from unify , where we put the rates
in .
one potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the
transport capacity tickets , we set up the rates for the transport usage
tickets . i am going through the transport usage tickets for february right
now ( as part of the market meter study ) and i see some rates i don ' t tie back
to lauri ' s matrix . for example , lauri ' s matrix shows 0 . 05 from thompsonville
to hsc , but the transport usage ticket ( updated by daren ' s group ) has 0 . 055 .
this means the economic estimate can be off . let me know what you want to do
with this .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

This was a dumb mistake on my part. I did'nt have libdvdcss-devel, the
transcode command line args work fine now, but not so for DVD::RIP.

"india : enron aftermath
business line - 02 / 21 / 2000
abhay mehta
copyright ( c ) 2000 kasturi source : world reporter ( tm ) -
asia intelligence wire
power play
a study of the enron project
* publishers : orient longman , new delhi * price : rs . 195
the enron power project at dabhol in ratnagiri district of maharashtra has
been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the
inception of the project proposal in 1992 ; and the sordid tale ends only
in 1997 , with the supreme court of india refusing to even
admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision , of december 1996 ,
which while commenting that "" this case has
highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of independence ,
political considerations outweigh the public interest and
the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to
justify its actions not only before the public but even before
the courts of law "" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the
project on the ( purely technical ) ground of res judicata , even
though new facts , new arguments , new evidence of the violation of the laws
of the land had been advanced by the petitioners .
the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and
recorded , despite the petitioners adducing the required
evidence , can only be termed as strange , perhaps bizarre .
abhay mehta ' s simple , factual documentation - in fact a chronological
narration - of all events , including the process of bending all
rules , of subverting the law for promoting a project involving
unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra , indeed for the whole of
india - is not only masterly , it is devastating .
it is a short , pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by
all thinking citizens of this country . barring the
concluding chapter , the epilogue , there are no personal comments , only
facts , disseminated from the original papers , mostly ' secret '
documents .
all documentation has been carefully , faithfully recorded , including
extracts from supposedly ' top secret ' minutes of cabinet
committee meetings ; and the specific violations of the law ( which were
opposed by a few public spirited civil servants , much to
their disadvantage ) have been pointed up . apart from an introductory
' primer on electricity ' - introduced for the benefit of the
layman , explaining some technical issues relating to electricity
generation , transmission and distribution - and the background of the
events of 1991 , the foreign exchange crisis , and the aftermath of the
crisis , the other fifteen chapters , three appendices and fourteen
annexes of the small book ( of 226 pages ) packs in an enormous volume of
factual information . the strange saga of the enron
project , and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single
project poses for the country , need to be briefly recounted
here , for essentially , it is the coming generation which would have to
face the problem .
the mseb has contracted to buy - and if not used , to pay for - 2000 mw of
electricity ( for a period of 20 years ) from the
dabhol power company ( the legal entity set up by enron , as an unlimited
liability company registered in india , through a maze of
intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more ' front '
companies registered in various tax - free havens .
abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over 20 years amount
to $ 35 billion ( at 1998 exchange rates , around rs .
1 , 25 , 000 crores ) over the life of the project . one must record that : ( a )
crude oil / oil product prices have as of writing , more than
doubled since the above calculations were made . a per the ' doctored '
figures presented by the company ( and its advocate ) , the
charge per unit of electricity supplied , at the 1998 level of prices , was
to 4 . 39 cent ( per unit ) as ' capacity charge ' and 3 . 43 cents
( per unit ) for ' energy costs ' .
the former is indexed to the us inflation rate , and the latter to
international fuel prices . the former may be assumed to have gone
up only marginally ( rounded to 4 . 4 cents per unit ) ; we know that fuel
prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999 .
assuming the ' fuel costs ' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even
though international prices have more than doubled - we
may assume ( for 1999 ) energy costs of 6 . 85 cents per units , making for a
total payment of 11 . 25 us cents per unit of electricity
supplied by the dabhol power company ( dpc ) to mseb in late 1999 , in phase
i of the project .
within another two years , at 2000 mw , the annual offtake ( for 365 days x
24 hours / day ) would be 17 . 52 billion kwh ; and at
11 . 25 cents per unit , the total payment amounts to $ 1 . 97 billion annually ;
for 20 years , this workout to $ 39 . 4 billion .
this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or
capacity charge . at today ' s exchange rate - about rs . 43 . 5 per us
dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs . 175 , 000 crores ( as
compared to rs . 125 , 000 crores indicated by abhay
mehta ) . this is the cost to mseb in rupee ; and to the country in foreign
exchange as payment to just one project authority , for
supply of part of the power required in maharashtra .
the really significant point to note in this connection is that this
payment - and considerably more , depending on ( a ) future increase
in ' capacity charges ' depending on us inflation rate , and international
prices of lngaphtha ( for ' fuel costs ' ) , and ( b ) depreciation of
the exchange rate of the rupee vis - a - vis the us dollar - is obligatory ;
the assets of the mseb , the maharashtra government
indeed , all assets of the government of india ( present and future ) are
mortgaged to enron , by way of sovereign guarantees
extended by both governments .
the other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by
all independent indian experts as well as the world bank - the
enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric
company ' s and its own much cheaper thermal power
already ; in a postscript dated august 1999 , abhay mehta has indicated that
already , the mseb had stopped buying between 200
and 250 mw of power from tata electric ( available at rs . 1 . 80 per unit )
and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal
power station ( cost of this power being rs . 1 . 20 per unit ) , while forced
to buy more expensive enron power at rs . 5 per unit .
the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs . 460 crore per year .
this had in fact , been predicted earlier even by the world bank .
it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was
contrived , by a deliberate campaign of ' disinformation ' , of
blatant lies , of sidelining of expert opinion , not only of independent
experts but also the goi ' s own official advisers in this matter ,
namely , the central electricity authority as well as that of the world
bank , which was resolutely opposed to this project . the
detailed facts , the letters exchanged in the above context , the pressure
tactics adopted , the flouting of all procedures norms , even
statutory provisions of the electricity ( supply ) act , are all carefully
documented by abhay mehta .
mehta correctly concludes : "" we frequently blame external agencies - like
the world bank - for all our problems , when , as a
matter of fact , we ourselves are our own worst enemies . in the instant
case , the world bank not only advised the government of
india against the project , it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of
the total inadvisability of this project . in fact , one must note
here that in 1996 , neighbouring pakistan , which had entered into a
somewhat similar mou with enron , cancelled the project ( and
the power purchase agreement with enron ) , for a $ 670 million , 782 mw
residual oil - fuelled power plant , even though that
agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6 . 4 us
cents per kwh over a 30 year period . ( note the
estimated rate of 11 . 25 cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in
december 1999 , which works out to around rs . 5
per unit ) .
one could go on ; but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehta ' s
crisp , factual , matter of fact narration of the enron
saga , and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the
story , about ' the next round of scams ' .
for quite some time , the ruling elite in india has been intent on
' privatising ' all public enterprises ; and even ' utilities ' are no
exception . the ' unbundling ' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation
of all the ' profitable ' segments . all this - as per the current
' disinformation campaign ' - is supposedly in the interest of
rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply .
the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the
government - by the torrent group - of the ahmedabad and
surat electricity companies at less than one - tenth of the market value of
the assets of thee facilities . again , much like the enron
saga , all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government
were overruled .
and , abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break - up of
power utilities into three segments , generation , transmission
and distribution , - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the
new thrust by the ruling elite , for reasons that do not require to
be spelt out .
though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad
and surat electricity companies , and of the break
up of the orissa state electricity board before him , yet his statement can
be stated today to be prophetic ; the upseb is now on
the firing line . the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the
upseb in protest of the announced up government decision
to trifurcate the upseb ; and the union minister of power , mr . rangarajan
kumaramangalam ' s statement that the upseb is a
loss making , inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities
after the trifurcation - need to be noted .
that 40 per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government ; that
tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up
government and not by the upseb ; that the upseb does not have the cash
even for routine maintenance as a result of the above
- these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider . that the
remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and
restructuring , is not even to be debated . the whole idea is to privatise
the profitable segments , and to leave the public sector entity
with all the problem areas , including rural energy supply . it is against
this background that abhay mehta ' s book needs to be widely
disseminated , read , and its implications understood .
what is at stake is not a ' utility ' here or a psu there . what is at stake
is the future of some 80 per cent of the have - nots in this
country .
what is at stake is the ' pillory ' of the assets of the nation for private
aggrandisement .

"My name is Yasuji Yagi, a merchant in Japan. I have recently been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer, which has defiled all medical treatment. Expert diagnosis has shown that I have few months to live.

The intention of this email is to employ the expertise of a business entrepreneur, who can identify a viable investment and guarantee reasonable returns on my wealth. This is to secure a future for my 4 years old son who lost his mother during birth. I cannot rely on his closest relatives any more, as they did not show responsible behaviour two years ago when I entrusted half of my wealth to them to invest on his behalf. They thought I wouldn't survive the operation and then used the money for their personal needs.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of USD$60 Million dollars. I will want you to help me collect this deposit .

To prevent any more mishaps, my attorney will act as a check, monitoring every aspect of the investment. Funds should be split in half and distributed to charity organisation and the other half, as investment for my son.

If this interests you, please reach me on this email address [yasujiyag@aim.com] to discuss terms and compensation.

"Dearest one,
Your contact came to me through some extensive search in the yellow pages and business guides. The truth remains that i need a competent foreign partner in the person of your respected self. To introduce myself, I am Mrs Olivia Mohabbat of the Ministry of Health in Mauritius.

Though constrained by inadequate information about you, I am relying on your genuineness and sincerity, knowing fully that the transaction will be beneficial to us in all aspects.

The transaction in question of which I am about to reveal to you, emanated from over-invoicing of contract awarded in my ministry for the supplies of medical equipment and quality health programs.

In the course of the contract awarded and executed, the approvals and payments were completed on my directives knowing fully that my commission will be paid out as agreed to a receiving vault as deposited valuables.

For full details, please kindly respond to my email addresses below

Thanks

"Good Day,

Greetings from Mr. Alex Gidonou. I am contacting you because I need a foreign partner to execute a project have been working on for the past twelve years. I am the Auditing and accounting director of Livex International Bank. I am writing in respect of one of our deceased foreign customer with account number 7016620987.

The Late Mr. Frederick Lloyd whom is one of the Directors of an oil company based in Benin Republic-West Africa, On Friday 26th December 2003, He was involved in a plane crash and unfortunately lost his life. Ever since then I have made several inquiries on the media to locate any of our clients extended relatives but my effort was not successful.

VIEW THIS WEB SITE FOR MORE INFO:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3348109.stm

We have not received any official claim for his money US$5M (Five Million, USD) with my bank because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds. I have secretly monitored his account opening files and all information's are in my custody and disposal. The amount stated above has been in the custody of my bank branch for over 16 years. Please note that following our banking rules & guidelines here funds of this nature if remained unclaimed for a period of 16 years will be confiscated by the federal government but due to the high level of government corruption among our senior government official they will now divert the funds to private pocket instead of government purse so for this reason I have decided to grab this opportunity myself because have seen government take advantage of monies of this nature too many times.

On this note, since I have all the required details I decided to seek your consent so you can be presented as Next of Kin to the deceased so my bank can award the funds to your favor without any breach of the law. If you agree to be my partner in this project I will give you 40% of the total amount, then 10% will be donated to an orphanage home here in Benin while the remainder 50% will be for me.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of application which you will type, sign and send back to our bank to enable us start this project. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has been finalized, this transaction will be completed within five business days of receiving your response, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.

I look forward to your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Alex Gidonou

Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. John Opare, I decided to communicate to you with my personal email id, for the sake of confidentiality of this transaction.

There had been a deposit worth Twenty Two Million USD (US$22,000,000.00) the fund was deposited for Safe Keeping with our bank by Mohamed Hassan from Libya.  And the fund deposit was made without any next of kin while this offers us the opportunity of having the fund transferred to you as the  sole Beneficiary though the fund was originally deposited by Mohamed Hassan.  We have tried to locate or contact Mohamed Hassan but with no avail.

Mohamed told us that he is a revolutionary fighter.  Maybe he had been killed in the battle for liberating Libya.

I know that if he do not show up or withdraw the fund within a short time, the bank management will surely confiscate the fund and share it among themselves, that is the reason I am contacting you so that we will have the fund transferred to your account rather than have the bank management confiscate the fund.

This transaction is 100% real and there is no risk involved.  It is my desire to release the fund  to you though we have to share the fund as follows, 60% to me while 40% will go to you, if you accept the offer then I will be expecting your urgent and sincere response. [johnopare@hotmail.com]

"Dear Beloved,
 
My greetings to you beloved one. My name is Mrs. Henry Joy a native of United States of America. I was married to Dr.Henry John ,an England Citizen (UK) who died of symptoms from HIV/AIDS Virus on 29th of December 2011, We were both married for 34 years without any child. Shortly after the death of my husband,i also tested HIV positive and have been on Anti-retrovirus drugs ever since. Last week i ran another test and my doctor confirmed that my case has gone worse,that i might not be able to live for more 2 months.
 
Presently, i am seriously sick tested HIV positive in the hospital now London-UK, Can you assist me in using my whole fund of $17.500,000usd in building charity organization in your country for poor people of God?
 
I and my late husband want you to use this fund for the proposed FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF BUILDING ORPHANAGE HOME/ CHARITY ORGANIZATION, FOOD PANTRIES, CLOTHES Financial and Security FOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE POOR CHILDREN IN YOUR COUNTRY. I got your e-mail contacts from computerized data are after my extensive search via the website for a God-fearing and trust-worthy person to bestow this Charity work in your hands. When i got your email address, I prayed and meditated fervently over it and i committed it into the hands of God, that you should be the rightful person to help me and my late husband out in handling this charity project before I made up my decision to contact you.
 
If you are to be trust worthy and legally fit for this project offer, i will offer to you 40% of the fund for you/your family use and then the rest 60% will go into my WISH as i just told you above. Trusting to hear from you immediately, my private email is [mrs.henryjoy2011@yahoo.co.uk]

"I'm Mr. Randy Buday, Managing Director of DHL Company in Africa Continent. I received a shocking email on Thursday 2nd of June 2015 from my colleague Mr. Frank Abenemi who just resumed office as the new DHL Services Manager in Nigeria. He informed me that he discovered a document in his new office which states that a package was registered with DHL Company in Nigeria on Wednesday 12th of March 2013 with your full name and home address where to deliver the package. The fund was awarded to you by the Africa Charity Organization when the body hosted their last scam victim compensation program in Abuja Nigeria on Monday 3rd February 2013. Your compensation amount is $1.5million USD,(One million five Hundred thousand United States Dollars. After the compensation was given, the Organization instructed Mr. Joseph Adeyinka to deliver the funds to you in cash. Mr. Joseph Adeyinka was the former DHL Services Manager in Nigeria who held the office for years before the current office holder Mr. Frank Abenemi takes over. As a matter of fact, the former DHL Services Manager in Nigeria is very dishonest man which is Mr. Joseph Adeyinka. I could not believe that he had not delivered the fund until I finally conducted my own investigations on this issue,that is after receiving the email from the current office holder. I completed my investigations regarding to this issue on Friday 8th of August 2015 and I found out that Mr Joseph Adeyinka never delivered the package to you as he claimed. I immediately contacted my attorney and we sued him to court for his corrupt practices. Last week Friday 21 August was the final court hearing and I am very much glad to inform you that he has released your funds as the court charged him according to his criminal offense. He is now on prison custody. You will have to let me know if you are prepared to receive the $1.5million USD now that these problems are over and everything is in good order. I look forward to receiving your mail.

Mr. Randy Buday

"sure what you're asking. Content-Type: message/rfc822 mails are handled like attachments and are not broken down further into mime parts. That is, the attachment is treated as one part. The headers and body of the message/rfc822 are sent to the server without parsing. The other way to handle it is to treat it like a regular mail, and break it down into parts. There are reasons to break it down and not to break it down, and right now we chose not to break it down.

subject : corn subsidy govt program analysis
hi vince ,
nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program . the consensus
from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically
driven , ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures . also it is
preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before , lending
more credibility in the ag community . the names that came up were
mississippi state and texas a & m . nelson knows of a person at mississippi
state who worked with the usda on risk management issues .
the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep , and the focus is
primarily to get a non - quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the
govt will want to worry about basis risk ) .
the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination .
another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination
side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent
of the premium received - - we still have unlimited downside from the short .

I am Mr. Alexander Jones (FCAA), the chief accountant of RAND MERCHANT BANK (RMB) South Africa. There is an account open in this bank in 1999 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account is Mr. Andreas Schranner, A German Businessman and a miner at Kruger Gold Company, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000.No other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the money involved is Twenty Five Million United States Dollars (USD$ 25,000,000.00).

I want us to first transfer USD$10 Million from this money into your safe overseas account before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in United States Dollars and the former owner Mr. Andreas Schranner is a foreigner too. You can view the web site bellow for more information on our late client.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

This deposit was for 5 years so it has over matured hence I made effort to contact my client but could not reach him. I was forced to travel to Germany and there I got the tragic news that, my client Mr. Andreas Schranner, his wife Maria, their daughter Andrea Eich, his son in law Christian, and their children Maximilian and Katharina, all perished on the Monday, 31 July, 2000 plane crash in western German city of Moenchengladbach. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of kin to the deceased as Indicated in our banking guidelines. It may interest you to know that I can have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-operate with me, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instruction and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity may never come again in my life. Please acknowledge receipt of this message before we negotiate your percentages on your response for  conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us for investment purposes, if this proposal is acceptable to you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you. I wait to hear from you soonest. Upon your acceptance of this proposal kindly call me or reply me via this email [alexjonesza@gmail.com]

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Alexander Jones

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .

"Good day,
With due respect and out of fear of the ugly situation I face presently, I am contacting you to see if you can help me solve my problem as I sincerely believe that one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life considering the situations the person finds his or herself.

I am Landry Didier the only Son of late Dr. Dominique Didier from Cote d`Ivoire. My Late Father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in the Northern part of Cote d`Ivoire; His death and that of my mum and my junior sister was masterminded by his only brother during the political crisis in my country Cote d`Ivoire in the years 2011. My late father through his hard work during his life time on earth made a fortune and established many businesses which has now been collected by his only brother the suspect that arranged the killing of my parents because of properties.

Through my findings I was able to get some personal documents of my late father and some was a fund deposit amounts to the tune of Eighteen  Million Seven hundred Thousand Dollars (US$18.700.000.00) he deposited with a bank under some conditions which necessitate this communication to you which I cannot handle under my age brackets. Presently I am hidden due to multiple attacks from my uncle who wished me dead or to obtain any other documents of my late father that is in my care and the condition of life is very unbearable most reasons I contacted you after much deliberations and prayers.

I am willing to offer you 30% of the total sum as compensation for your EFFORT/INPUT after a successful transfer of the said funds into your Bank account and also for you to assist me relocate over there as soon as the bank transfers the money into your bank account to enable me have my peace and continue my education over there. Therefore I wish to know your readiness to assist me sincerely over this matter to enable me go further in discussing in details with you and also to enable me send you all vital deposit documents.

MY QUESTION IS CAN YOU SINCERELY ASSIST ME ON THIS ISSUE? If Yes, then I am Looking forward to your immediate response through my private email as follows ( didier.landry@outlook.com )

"http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.htmlHamza's horrid - but we must tolerate himRod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianSheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

Dear Sir/Madam, 

I have written this to so many with no reply. I have tried explaining but most replies I get keep saying that my intenton is to ask for money from foreigners. I hope it doesn't look same to you as I do not need anyone's money. I saw your email from an internet magazine shared amongst all workers in my place of work to promote our knowledge on internet browsing as it is done in Nigeria these days. 

I would plead that you ignore my bad English as my level of English language is poor as I am not fully educated. 

I am Mr. Kola Fashonu, I am a Cleaner at the First Bank of Nigeria East Branch, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. I am a very loyal worker of the Bank and very faithful to my Job. This brought me the trust that I had with my Bank Manager (Mr. Akin Sodimu). 

It was on a Monday as I had so many cleaning do to despite being absent from work the previous week due to my late wife's burial. I was called into the office of my Manager.Getting to his office, he brought out a box and said he wanted me to keep it for him. I knew it was money it contained but I didn't know how much exactly until he informed me that it contained the sum of $20,015,000 (Twenty Million and Fifteen Thousand Dollars) which he stole from the Bank's account. He said that I should keep it safe in my house until he needed it and that he owes me 10% of the money. I asked him why he chose me and he replied saying that I was the only one he trusted. I agreed because I was only a cleaner and needed to be rich (even if the money was stolen). I borrowed a video recorder on getting home and instructed my 15 year old son to film me while I counted the money and I kept the money safe as promised. 

My reason for emailing you came when the Bank Manager died as i found out he was killed by armed robbers who came to his house on a robbery mission. On this there was no way that I could use the money since I had no lie to say on how I got the money as my job will not get me such money. This is the reason I am emailing you tio inform you that I wish to transfer this money to the care of a foreign person that way I know for sure that the funds will have no trace. I am not requesting mony nor your bank details. All I want is for you to give me your name and address and I will give the box to my elder sister who is the head of East Branch of the UPS Courier Delivery and she'll personally drop the box in your house. That way the box will not be inspected as she is teh head of all inspection officers in the UPS. I would require a residential or an official address as my sister would not meet with anybody in an hotel, restuarant, park, airport to exchange the box of money. Any meeting with her will be valid for home or office address. If this is not acceptable by you, kindly do not reply as I wouldn't take any risk with the money or my sister's life. 

You will also be required to show to my sister an identity card or driver's licence when she meets with you. This is for her to know that she has met with the right person. Failure to produce this will mean that she cannot meet with you as the money will not be safe and note that all expenses have been taken care of and you will not be asked to pay anything at all. I do not need your money at all just your sincere help. on your receipt of the box, kindly inform me and I will travel to your country as I have removed some money from the money that will secure me and my son a flight ticket from Nigeria to your country. You can have 30% from the money and keep the 70%. 

Please do not let anyone know about this not even a closet person or lawyer because this is the only way that we can do this transaction since I myself didn't tell anyone except my sister since she is the one helping us to transport the box to your location. 

I hope to recieve an encouraging reply from you. Kindly send a reply to my email kkfashonu@yahoo.ie as this email I used in sending ths belongs to a friend. So it will be improper to state conversation from a friend's email. 

Have a nice day

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"Mr. Edward E. David.
Inspection Unit
The Delivery of Your Consignment Boxes
J.F Kennedy International Airport New York
Reply To This Email: edwarderick977@gmail.com

Good day

I am Edward E. David, the new Chief Inspection Agent- United Nations Inspection Unit at John F. Kennedy International airport, New York-working hand in hand with Department of Homeland Security and U.S Customs and Border Protection. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from Africa and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk boxes weighing approximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the shipping agent and also the Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.

On my assumption, each of the boxes contains $3 Million, which is total of $6 Million USD. is still left in the storage house till today. The consignment are two metal boxes with weight of about 25kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 110 LBS). Approximately, the details of the consignment including your name and address, the official document from United Nation office in Africa are tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.

PROVIDE YOUR NAME, ID CARD, PHONE NUMBER AND FULL HOME ADDRESS, TO CROSS CHECK IF IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE CONSIGNMENT INCLUDING THE NAME OF NEAREST AIRPORT AROUND YOUR CITY AND OTHER DETAILS.

You can send the required details to me by email for onward delivery. All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can get everything concluded within 5-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery if you assure of giving me something out of the fund (financial gratification) on my arrival to your house.

Note: the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s) from Africa where the consignment, etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or i can deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project. Make sure Respond to me via my direct E-mail: (edwarderick977@gmail.com) send all the requested information to my email.

Mr. Edward E. David.
Administrative Service Inspection Unit.
Inspection Head Officer in-Charge.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .

"Dear

l am Mr Badger Martin, Personal Private Accountant to Mr Davy Gerardus Hally I contacted you to seek your assistance to transfer the sum of money (US$43,900,000.00) out of the CIBC Bank to your custody for investment purpose of which you are going to provide an investment proposal we are going to embark on of which the profits would be shared 40% for you and 60% for me.

Davy Gerardus Hally who died in the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash, with his wife and daughter has an account with the CIBC Bank with US$43,900,000.00.

After further investigation it was discovered that Mr Davy Gerardus Hally  did not declare any next of kin in his official paper work of his account,as his private account officer l was aware of the $43.9M USD deposited in his personal account and nobody else is aware of this funds. now this is the funds we are going to partner together to pull out from the bank since no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me the most is that according to the laws of (CIBC Bank) at the expiration of Four years,the funds will revert to the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Davy Gerardus Hally so that you will be able to receive his funds as my partner since i am the only one aware of this,I will make you the next of kin to this account since I have full access to the document.

I will appreciate if you are interested  to assist with this,i will need some information from you so that i can key in your data as the beneficiary to the funds, details needed here would be:

Your Full Names:
Your Complete Residential Address:
Country of Residence and Birth:
Occupation:
Telephone/Mobile Number:

This project is highly capital intensive for me as i would need to employ the services of a solicitor that would prepare the legal documents to back your claims as the benefactor, every step has to be legally guided this is why I have to be very careful I need your total devotion,honesty and trust to see this through. I would wait for your reply and you can reach me on text only (+1-605-609-6627) as from 4.00 p.m upwards my time here because i have installed the phone basically for the purpose of this transaction and i would not want to be using it while working.I would wait for your details and willingness to work with me so that i can provide you with more information on how to achieve our primary goal.

"louise ,
i thoroughly enjoyed our telephone conversation several weeks ago . as
promised , i am following up with some thoughts on how we might best use the
time i have on your calendar next week . i am very much looking forward to
the visit with you and some of your team members . joining me on the visit
will be yoko sugiura selden . she works with me in my consulting business
and is also helping me with the course . she is a former investment banker
and joined my firm after we were married . i thought i might indicate some
of the discussion areas i would like to explore .
just to remind you , i have launched a brand new course at columbia
university , graduate school of business , titled internet financial
management . the theme of the course is how companies can use the internet
to create sustained excess shareowner returns . this theme applies equally
to pure - play b 2 b and b 2 c companies as well as to the bulk of traditional
companies that are trying to figure out how best to leverage the internet in
their "" normal "" course of business . to describe this process i have used the
term "" e - tizing "" . by that i mean the total transformation of a firm ' s
business processes such that all relevant operations and communications ,
whether they are internal ( i . e . , among operating units and functions ) or
external ( i . e . , between a firm and its customers , suppliers and alliance
partners ) , are performed on the internet . obviously the decision of where
to "" e - tize "" and where not to is ultimately an roi question . ( by the way , ge
uses the term "" digitizing "" for roughly the same notion . )
in order to make the course experience for the students especially valuable
and to provide a much broader exposure for columbia in the internet area , i
have departed from the typical course format in two key ways . first , since
everything is moving too quickly for a textbook to exist , i have assembled a
world - class group of lecturers who have kindly agreed to make the time to
join us . second , the students are grouped in teams to work on specific
action learning projects with corporate sponsors . in addition , geoff colvin
of fortune and i are writing up the lecturers and will craft them into a
series of fortune articles . so far we have been very fortunate , the
speakers have been extremely accommodating and absolutely outstanding in
both content and delivery - not to create any pressure ! ! to give you a
feel , terry jones , the ceo of travelocity , will be spending a good deal of
time on this coming monday discussing the implications of what he has
learned , in creating one of the most effective internet sales and marketing
machines , for traditional companies that sell to consumers .
as further background , the student teams are working with applied materials ,
travelocity , trilogy and barnes & noble . com . this small set of companies
represents a nice cross section of b 2 b , b 2 c and more traditional brick and
mortar companies . irrespective of the company setting , each student team
will be focusing on projects that deal with using the internet to create
sustained excess shareowner returns . the target fortune audience will also
cover a broad cross section of companies , but with an emphasis on
traditional non - pure play internet enterprises .
louise , with respect to your presentation , i would like for you to explore a
fairly specific set of issues so that ( a ) the student teams will be able to
use the learnings to leverage their projects with their sponsor companies
and ( b ) the series of lectures will mesh together very effectively for our
writing for fortune .
for the non - pure play internet companies , i want to use ge and enron as best
practice examples . i have been meeting extensively with the ge folks and am
beginning to get a pretty good handle on what they are doing today and what
they are likely to be doing over the next few years . in the same vein , i
view my visit to enron as having three primary goals : ( i ) getting to know
you and some of the enron management team , ( ii ) getting a good understanding
of how your business is using the internet to create shareowner value and
( iii ) establishing a working outline for your session in april . clearly ( i )
and especially ( ii ) will form the basis for ( iii ) .
i have scheduled the following times with tammie to meet with you and / or
your team :
february 21 : 12 : 00 - 3 : 30 - - louise ( work on ( ii ) and plan for feb . 22 )
february 22 : 8 : 00 - 2 : 30 - - work with other team members
february 22 : 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 - - louise ( review learnings and plan ( iii ) )
a sampling of the kinds of questions i would like to investigate would be
the following :
- is the essence of what you have accomplished the creation of a totally new
business or "" e - tizing "" a pre - existing business ?
- how pervasive is the use of the internet in the day - to - day running of
enron ? for example , has enron gone the route of cisco and ge in trying to
e - tize sufficiently to close your books globally on a daily basis ?
- to what extent is the approach of your business to the internet creating
or forcing compatibility of technology / information systems between you and
your "" customers "" ( i . e . , trading partners ? ) and "" suppliers "" ( participants in
the physical value chain ? ) ?
- we discussed the critical role of process definition and detailed mapping
to your success . could you outline for us the process and what are the 5 - 10
major success factors and 5 - 10 "" failure "" factors ?
- from a technology perspective , i believe you mentioned that you first
looked outside for a solution and found that typical erp type approaches
would have required such massive modifications , that you felt "" starting from
scratch "" would be more valuable . i would like to discuss that in more
detail . also , how did you systematically tackle the task ? what was the
timeline ? having been through the experience , what are the key learnings
for next time - - - what not to do , what to do more off and how to go faster ?
- also , on the technology level i would be very interested in learning about
the full set of technology building blocks - - including telecom , hardware
( servers , routers , etc . ) , storage ( software and hardware ) , content software .
also along those lines , what are the costs - - capital , set - up and
maintenance ? ( should this be 2 % or 10 % of revenue ? )
- how is the overall technology investment managed so as to get optimal
synergies and yet not impinge on the distinctive diverse needs of various
different businesses in enron ?
- how are you measuring "" customer , "" "" supplier , "" and operational metrics
differently due to your internet efforts ? how has this change the form ,
content and use of your financials ?
after reading this e - mail , if you have any thoughts please don ' t hesitate to
give me a call ( 212 - 688 - 2034 ) or send an e - mail message .

ATTENTION TO ALL OUR CUSTOMERS:

This is to about the latest development concerning all the payment that are left in our custody, which yours are inclusive, Besides, we tried so many times earlier this year to transfer your fund to you but it failed because your name is blocked from receiving and sending money in and out of the country of which you were told to pay the sum of $150.00 in order to unlock your name to start receiving your payment of which we did not hear from you for sometime now, Hence, our Western Union Head Office is now offering a Special BONUS to help all our customers that are having their payment in our custody due to inability to complete the transaction process because of one reason or the other. In order words we are now requesting that those involve should pay only the sum of $50, to enable the Western Union Head Office unlock their names and start sending your payment $5000.00, twice daily and you will receive all your payment abandoned in our custody which is total sum of $1,800,000.00.

My dear this is the opportunity for you to comply with the instruction and your funds shall be transferred to your designated address But remember that after (THREE DAYS) and you did not make the payment then we will divert your funds to the Central Bank Of this Country as Government Funds, to avoid problem or we will cancel the payment for this year until next year because this year is not like last year.

Again after (3 DAYS ) We will enter A new project for the year ending and that is the reason why we decided to help all our customers before we enter into the new project. So be advised to send the $50, immediately so that we will register your payment for you to start receiving $5000, twice daily from today.

Note that the fee should be sent through steam wallet card as you are still blocked from sending money out but after the payment of $50, we will unlock your name from the US.DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM for easy transfer of your fund, Also the total amount we will transfer to you is$1,800,000.00, usd only.

"sum : v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the "" fossilized noun-class prefix "" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",0,0,"[""\u0120lex"", ""\u0120several"", ""\u0120query"", ""\u0120connection"", ""<s>"", ""sum"", ""\u0120weeks"", ""\u0120ago"", ""\u0120posted"", ""\u0120items""]","[0.10370659308250652, 0.08709346553609976, 0.08357706473066173, 0.08357706473066173, 0.04053892435240414, 0.04053892223259936, 0.035457435525131586, 0.035457433107467295, 0.035457433107467295, 0.03052623989856329]","[""posted"", ""languages"", ""a"", ""lexical"", ""asked"", ""in"", ""initial"", ""verbs"", ""exceedingly"", ""50""]","[0.08102942977274002, 0.0808041864202474, 0.07158899858437423, 0.06593288989758816, 0.06147448755725082, 0.05179681880080497, 0.05066302264084362, 0.04903361824966573, 0.0353489173973082, 0.028417715878087366]"

"Our Ref: CBA / IRD / CBAX / 889 / 2020.

Dear Sir,

I sincerely apologized for sending you this sensitive information through e-mail instead of a certified mail, post-mail, telephone or face to face conversation, it's due to the urgency and importance of the security information.

My name is Mr. Tony Williams. The new Director Of International Remittance, Central Bank Of Africa Sarl {CBA} this note was taken in my office where one of our managers was serving verification documents to two White men. Mr. Eric Edward and Mr. Tommy Morris who stormed our office on your behalf.

These two white men claimed to be your representative here and your supervisory Engineer so they came to supervise your payment with our Bank on your behalf and to claim your payment but because of their inability to have paid at the agreed time. They said that you were dead and before your death, you appointed them as the next of kin to your compensation, Inheritance / Next of Kin payment presently under our custody. these two white men and A black man quickly applied that your payment should be present to them at spot.

The Officials that is responsible for the presentation of the consignment quickly granted APPROVALS to their application and packaged your payment for them to go with it. When the Ivory Security Company & Sacc. Services Debit teams arrived and the note was submitted to my desk for final Approvals before forwarding it to them for endorsement, I noticed that there were discrepancies as there was no evidence of authorization letter from you for the change of beneficiary & information.

Myself as the New Director of International remittance of The Central Bank Of Africa Sarl urgently summoned The Officials responsible for the presentation of the consignment and directed them to stop the movement of the funds and at the same time I placed a stop order
instruction on the funds pending when your views and comments are received with regards to this matter?

Meanwhile your immediate report is highly needed, for us to attach their picture for your perusal and file and response to me will be highly imperative for your comments which will be highly appreciated, but we will not hesitate to continue the payment transmission to them if no response comes from you. So contact me via the telephone or Email: ( cntbnkafc@gmail.com) immediately as your silence will be a clear indication that you authorized them to effect the above changes on your behalf!?!?!?

Note! when reporting back to me do re-confirm your full information as below for our perusal and file before we can be able to arrest them and deliver your Consignment of Funds to you immediately through diplomatic tunnel on non inspection route direct to your doorstep over there or via International Cashier's Check, ATM Swift Card or through Bank to Bank Wire transfer any of your choice Viz:

(1) Your Full Name:
(2) Your Residence or Office address where the consignment can be delivered to you immediately.
(3) Your Mobile Telephone Number for easy communication.
(4) Your Company's Name & Address {IF ANY}
(5) Sex / Age / Occupation.
(6) This is to avoid wrongful delivery of your valued payment to wrong hand or wrong person.

(7) If you want the Funds transferred to you VIA Bank to Bank wire transfer direct to any of your choice bank account any where in the world, then you have to send us your below information:

(A) Full Name:
(B) House or Office Address:
(c) Direct Telephone Number:
(D) Bank Name:
(E) Bank Address:
(F) Account Number:
(G) Account Holder Name:
(H) ABA / Routing Numbers:

Let us know the option you choose to receive your payment before we can proceed!?!?!? as indecision and delays are the parents of failure so avoid them now If we delay a decision, the opportunity is gone forever. sometimes our doubts keep us from making a choice that involves change. Thus an opportunity may be missed as delay is the enemy of progress. we are looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
Mr. Tony Williams.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"dear cassandra ,
thanks for the message . i believe it if fully understood by us and the
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the
traders . are you in addition saying that your group ( who has been very
helpful in the past ) will no longer help us understand the cause of
violations / notifications ? to me , this appears contrary to a team spirit
attitude , and not reflective of what you and i and vlady and i had discussed
earlier today . also , we are working toward getting the memos out earlier ,
and this is a real set back to that process .
thoughts ?

subject : limit violations and notifications process
shona -
to share with the others our telephone discussion , the notification template
was not my request , it was requested directly by skilling . i know your group
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations , and in accordance with your
request below , market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements . the new p / l
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications , so that should
help . it probably makes sense to re - distribute the policy to your business
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements .
another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation
explanations . these should be provided to you by the head trader of that
commodity group . under the policy , that commodity group manager is
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the
commodities under his responsibility , along with the head of the energy ops
for that commodity group . if the traders are not providing these
explanations to you or to your counterparts ( ops desk head / business unit
controller ) , i ' ll be happy to send them an e - mail explaining their compliance
obligation under the policy . why don ' t you talk to each of the business unit
controllers , consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback
( as i understand it is for global products , for example ) , and if you ' d like
me to send an e - mail to whoever you ' re having difficulty with , i will - just
let me know who . our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their
explanations , but the problem is , they can see whether they ' re short or long
and how the market moved in comparison , but it ' s the trader that can and
should explain why they took a position , whether they ' re adjusting it based
on the market moves , etc . .
let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process .
regards ,
cassandra .

dear cassandra ,
in looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us , one in
the template itself , and some suggestions . at your request , we have started
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation / notification memos
and our other work . as you have certain requests and requirements , it would
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to
ensure it meets your requirements .
please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be .

subject : 12 / 5 limit violations and notifications - comments
i realize this has already gone out , but i see a few errors that we should
correct - and actually , i think we should call skilling and lay ' s ( and
buy ' s ) assistants ( veronica will handle this ) and see if we can just hand
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning , e - mail is ok for ted ,
david and i . i have a few other suggestions on format / reporting changes as
well .
the na power var of $ 51 mm was not 105 % over its var limit of $ 50 - that would
have been $ 52 . 5 to require a report to skilling , ( but if we had had to report
it , don ' t use "" wscc "" , try to spell out or just don ' t use )
uk gas ' s var limit is not $ 4 , it ' s $ 7 . 5 mm
i can ' t tie in uk gas ' qtd and ytd p / l - shouldn ' t it be what ' s on the dpr ,
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call
over to that yeo person and get the info . from them please
the 2 nd item for na gas shouldn ' t be listed like that as it looks like
another violation - the comment re : the var increase was mean to go at the
bottom under rac comments
the finance committe chairman notification for agg . var is not 100 % , it ' s
115 % ( notification requirement box )
ees had a var violation - $ 7 . 5 vs . 7 - that is a skilling level violation
let ' s have the "" re : "" say "" limit violations and notifications for december 5 ,
2000 ""
let ' s number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level
veronica will call you to coordinate re - distribution .
going forward , we need to increase our level of review for these as they ' re
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk .
thank you ,

i suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers . they only know how
to stop things , but in a way they play a role in global society . if it were
not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a

sorry for a delay in getting back to you .
i have one challenge i did not anticipate

internal seminar .
the materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school , and there is some sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the

outside enron .

around this issue .

Re:-Fund Transfer Notice. 

Sir Your representative Mr. Bills Edmonton Jr was in the Bank today, As a matter of fact we are going to work according to your instruction since He is ready to pay the $950 on your behalf for the transfer charges, but why we need you to respond back before we release your contract/inheritance fund of USD$10.5 million dollars to Him, but why we need to hear from you before we release the fund to him is that he gave us a new account in Canada. Here is the new Bank Information we received from Him today.

Bank Address: 370 Connell St. Unit 5 Woodstock , New Brunswick , Canada E7M 5G9 Swift Code: CIBC CATT

Please confirm this so that we will finalize your transaction this week since he told us that you gave him $950 to pay on your behalf for the transfer charges.

Compliment of the day!

I am Abdel Mustafa, son of Dr. Fidel Mustafa of Libya who was confidant to Late Muammar Gaddafi, former president of Libya.

The Libya crisis compelled our family to Exile/asylum. Billions of United States Dollars was moved out of Libya government treasury by the ex-president.

My mother and I want to move usd24m which is deposited with our fathers name to your custody/account for safe keeping and investment on behalf of our family.

Presently Muammar Gaddafi has died and he can't ask my family about the fund as our father was assassinated as a result of the crisis.

Upon receipt of your reply, we shall discuss partnership terms.

Please let this remain a top secret between you and I.

Now our family is in Nigeria on asylum.

Thus far, the Nigerian government has not traced this bank and it will remain so, to the extent that you are willing to work confidentially. I am offering 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 80% will be for my client. I assure you that this transaction is risk-free. More details will be availed to you upon your reply with required information.

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"Attention: Esteemed Beneficiary This letter is written to you in order to change your life from today. I am Richard Howarth, the new director of SunTrust Bank international remittance department.the MD/ CEO of this Bank is now on compulsory leave and all power has been vested on me to make all international payment.Furthermore due to allegations of corrupt practices against other Nigerian Banks, the Federal Government of Nigeria has appointed this Bank to effect all foreign overdue payment. Be informed that the Federal Government have Approved the release of $10.5M which has been in this Bank for many years UNCLAIMED. My boss in collaboration with the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have refuse to tell you the truth on how to claim your fund.This is because they have been using the interest accumulated from your fund every year to enrich themselves without your knowledge. I want to help you PULL OUT this fund to your Bank account today using the easiest and quickest method which has not been known to you before. By this method a Domiciliary Account will be opened for you in our Bank. A domiciliary account is a secure account which we will open for you in our Bank and Credit your payment of $10.5M for further credit into your account.The essence of this Domiciliary account is to secure and protect your payment from being diverted by fraudulent people or making payment to a foreign account which do not belong to you.The greatest advantage is that you can instruct us to credit your nominated account bit by bit with small amount thereby saving yourself from the trouble of Financial Authority in your country who monitor large transfer due to current trend of terrorism. Another beauty of the domiciliary account is that you can retain the balance left in your account in our Bank and can also instruct us to pay out money to any Bank of your choice in the world, or issue you an ATM Card which you can use in any part of the world when on a business trip. I hope you now understand the advantages of a Domiciliary account and why you need this account to receive your payment of $10.5M now in our Bank....You are advice to forward as a matter of urgency your full banking coordinate, direct telephone and Fax number and your contact address as we have started the process of the account for you. Kindly call or sms me on: +2347058448892, so that I will issue you a payment release code which must be given to you personally on telephone strictly for security reason. This code is very important and it is what you will use to confirm your payment.

Compliments of the day and God's blessings. I am glad to inform you that I have successfully concluded the transaction, the money has been transferred to London. I suceeded through the assistant of Mr. Patrick Richmond who is a Sidney base business man, he cleared the fees and the fund was transfered to his account. Currently I am in Auatralia with him and my wife and children.
However, I did not forget you because you are the source of my success, you made me what I am now though you weren't there to complete this project with me, but I give all the credit and thanks to you for your past efforts . I know it is not your fault or rather your wish to back out on me and the transaction. I understand it was your situation then.
In appreciation towards your assistance, I have mapped out as a compensation and wrote on your favor a certified bank draft worth of US$3M (THREE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). I left the draft with my Secretary Mrs. Jennifer Vignon on my departure to Australia.

We have signed and sealed all the papers related to this delivery to you that we should return this atm card worth $1,9million to Federal Treasury Department. I am no more waiting for you for this delivery but bear it in mind that if you still want this atm card to be deliverd to your house that you should rush now and send this last fee of $75 and have your atm card delivered to you.Failure to send the fees today, then forget about this atm card because by tomorrow, it will be government own.

If you are blocked from using western union or money gram then go and buy Steam Wallet Card or iTunes Card $50/$25 to avoid any mistake or delay and send. Make sure you do it today if you really want your atm card but failure to do it today then you will lose your funds. I have tried and can not continue waiting or writing you day by day

So you are advised to go right now and get the $75 done so that I can proceed and get everything done Asap

my advisor ( arie segev at haas school of business ; segev @ haas . berkeley . edu )
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer , while i am staying there .
his interest is in e - business . . ( what else . . ? )

he wants to do some kind of technical case study

he may travel one or two times to houston to have a meeting during the

"    THIS MAIL IS ONLY FOR THE OWNER OF THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS:

    How are you today? Please can you confirm this to us before we make a mistake, somebody called me today with this number 706-925-5615 saying that he is your brother, he said that you died since 3 days ago and before this happened you asked him to receive the funds on your behalf. He forwarded his address for us to send the REF# direct to him;

    1121 Odena RD S
    Sylacauga, AL - USA 35150

    But we are not sure about this. So that is why i am writing to know if this is true or not. Regarding the fee $100 which you are supposed to send earlier, I tried letting him know of the required fee he said that i should give him information to send the $100 so that we can update the payments then send the mtcn numbers to him since you are not alive again.

    Please this fund is not something we could just make any silly mistake or sending it to the wrong person because the money is huge amount of money $2.5 million us dollar So this man is getting us confusing on what he is saying.

    I am sending this mail to you to find out the truth before i make any mistake. I told the man to give me 2days to think about it. The man said that his name is MR.LARRY Phillip he is from USA. So am sending this message to confirm the truth but if i don't hear from anyone in the next 2days i will collect the $100 from him and hand over everything to him
    You are advice to reconfirm the following info;
    this the information that you use to send the fee if your alive
     
    now i want you to know that if you know that your not the one who send this man try to make sure that you get back to us with the mtcn number of the $100 today that is the only thing  you can do today so that you will be able to have your mtcn number of you first payment of $6,000 today with out any delaying, and i will promise you that once you send the $100 today MR LARRY Phillip  will be arrested today because he want to claim what dose not belong to him, so now try to get back to me with the mtcn number of the $100 only because that $100 is the only thing that is delaying your first payment of $6,000 since and i swear to God almighty who made me that once you send the $100 today and get back to me with the mtcn number today once we arrested Mr Larry gale today i will get back to you with the mtcn number of your first payment of $6,000 today.
    may God almighty bless you.

    THIS IS THE INFORMATION TO SEND THE $100 TODAY ONCE YOUR  ALIVE

Greetings!!!

I am Hon. Rodriquez Manfred Esq, the English speaking Beninese, Solicitor and Financial Consultant/ Attorney Cotonou Republic of Benin. After much consideration on this subject matter, I have decided to contact you believing that you will protect this transaction and give it the Attention it deserves. I was moved to contact you based on the present condition of things here. I am the Personal Attorney to late Mr. George Marshal, a national of your country who was a contractor here in Benin Rep. who was on December 26th 2003, with his entire family was perished in a forceful Auto Crash along Togo Cotonou Express way.

I would like you to collaborate with me as the next of kin to the deceased client who made a fixed deposit valued at (USD$10.8M) United States dollars only with a notable Bank here in Benin Republic. He died without any registered next of kin designate and as such his funds now have an open beneficiary mandate.

I seek your good partnership & co-operation to do this and I wish to know if we can work together to claim his funds in a Bank Benin. I will guide you discreetly on any information that may be required of you from the Bank for us to make this claim for our mutual disbursement.

If you are interested, Please do let me know so that I can give you comprehensive details on what we are to do. I urgently hope to get your response as soon as possible. Please reply to my private email for security reasons email: { manfredabaslawfirm@gmail.com} Email address :

Best wishes.

Dear Friend,

Permit me to introduce myself to you. I am Miss sarah  kouassi, 20 years of age the only child and Daughter of late Mr  kouassi Aruma, from Ivory Coast. I want to use this medium to request for your assistance for relocation and investment establishment in your custody by transferring my inherited money into your bank account. My late father Mr  kouassi Aruma, was a businessman before he was assassinated he died on 13th of October 2013. Some months after the death of my father, two of my uncles conspired against me and sold my father?s properties to a Chinese businessman all because I am a girl.

A week ago, I opened my father’s briefcase and saw some documents which my late father used and deposited money in a Bank here in Ivory Coast with my name as the next of kin. I have tried to withdraw the money so that I can start a better life and take care of myself.

The Branch manager of the Bank whom I met in person told me that my present status doesn?t permit me by the local laws to clear money or make a transfer of money into an account. He advised me to present somebody or a company to stand on my behalf who will help me and invest the money or I should wait till when I will be 25 years old according to the law of Ivory Coast.

I have chosen to contact you and would like you to take me as your own blood and help me. I will like to disclose much to you if you can help me to relocate to your country because my uncle has threatened to kill me. The amount of the money is (2.8 Million Euro only) and I have confirmed it from the bank.

You will help me to place the money in a more profitable business investment in your Country. You will also help by getting a nice school in your country so that I can complete my studies. It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your services and the balance shall be my capital in your establishment.

As soon as I receive your interest in helping me, I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating tour ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely. Please do keep this only to yourself. I beg of you not to disclose it to anyone until I come over to your country because I am afraid of my wicked uncle?s who has threatened to kill me.

Thanks and God bless you.
Yours sincerely.
Miss sarah  kouassi.

Dearest one,
 
I am writing to you in a most desparate and pitiable situation in which I find myself. And is my pleasure to write you after much consideration, since I can not be able to see you face to face at first, please I need your kind Assistance. I am Raymund Okoba Ibrahima, the only Son of late Chief Johnson Okoba Ibrahima Nationality Liberia, I am Residing in Cote d’Ivoire due to my father's Nature of business.
 
My father was a liability Cocoa and Gold merchant here in Cote d’Ivoire before his untimely death. After his business trip to Tunisia, to negotiate on a cocoa and gold business he wanted to invest in Tunisia, a week after he came back from Tunisia, he had an accident with my mother of which my mother died instantly but my father died seven days after in a Private Hospital. On that fateful afternoon, I didn't know that my father was going to leave me after I had earlier lost my mother, but before he gave up to ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die.
 
He My father, (OF BLESSED MEMORY) called me to his bed side and told me that he deposited the sum of ($7.7m)Seven Million Seven hundred Thousand US Dollars in a bank here in Cote D' Ivoire.That the money was meant for his cocoa and Gold business he wanted to establish in Tunisia, according to my father he deposited the money in a Fixed/Suspense account using my name as the next of kin, He instructed me to seek for a Reliable, God fearing and Trustworthy business partner for my life time investment. Now I have succeeded in locating the deposit documents and the bank where this money is been deposited. Due to my inexperience in business here in Cote d'Ivoire, I am now seeking for your assistance to help me transfer this money from my country to your account so that we should invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business in your country in which you will suggest because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 20% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.
 
DEAR ONE I SEEK YOUR KIND ASSISTANCE IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS RESPECTFULLY;
 
(1.) Provision of a bank account where this money can be transferred into.
(2.) To make arrangements for me to come over to your country after the successful transferring of this money into your account and to come and further my Education.
(3.) To help me invest this money in a profitable business, since I do not know much about business.
(4) To sponsor me transfer this money into your account,
(5). I want you to promise me that you are not going to betray me after the money gets into your account.
 
The worst part of it is that my uncle is planning evil against me over this money because i refused to hand him over the documents covering this money, He has sold all my father's landed properties including his cars which Rightful belong to me and now he wanted me to hand him over the banking documents of my father in my possession which i refused. Now he said that he will have this money by all means even if it means killing me, so because of this I ran away from home and hide in a Guest House, pending when this money will be transferred so that i can leave the country for my safety.
 
Please i am looking forward to hear from you,
 
Thank You and God bless.

"Dear Sir,
My name is  Gregory Hicks, a US citizen, presently serving in Mosul, Iraq.

I have a very  urgent  need for assistance, I will disclose and provide adequate proof of  my  identity,and also explain how I got  your contact,but I must have some  assurances that you will not use such delicate information against me. I feel quite safe reaching you through this medium,although it has`been greatly abused, it  still remains one of the fastest and cheapest means of communication, this is also apart from the fact thatI have veryrestricted access to other means of communication.
 
However, this  correspondence is unofficial and should be treated as such.I have to urgently move  some  money out of here to a safe country as soon as i can have some assistance, and  I have discovered a secure way of doing so, I will explain the  source of money to you when I  am convinced that you sincerely want to work with me, but I assure you of your safety as far as this project is concerned.
 
Concealing  this money here has been a big problem/source of distraction to  me,  what I  require from you now is the assurance that you will honor my conditions, mostly as regards  taking care of my  share until  I complete my service here, and preserving all information relating to this.
 
I am offering  you  Six million dollars ($6,000,000) for your prospective role, but should  you have reasons to reject this  offer, please destroy this mail as any  leakage will be too  bad for us. I will continue with the details when you signify your intention to work with me.

"yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

Hello,

I am Dr. E.N. Dan-Kano; the Head of the Directorate of Petroleum and Pipeline Marketing (DPPM), Nigeria. The DPPM is an agency of the Nigerian government with exclusive oversight on the international trade of Nigeria?s Petroleum and products. This is why we also maintain a permanent presence here in the London International Petroleum Exchange (IPE).

I have US$23.8Million that I need your assistance to relocate it into the safety of your account. I accumulated the money by supplying more quantities of petroleum to buyers - than what was recorded and reported to the government. Supplies were under-invoiced. The entire payments all went straight into our account with the national financial institution. But that is never a problem as I am the signatory and custodian of the account by virtue of my position as the director of the DPPM.

I am contacting you today as I am about to be relieved of my position as the DPPM director, due to the change in the political leadership in our country. I need to transfer this money out of our account without delay.

I would have the fund processed and transferred into your account as a legal and due contract payment for a contract job you did for the DPPM some few years ago. Your occupation or vocation is not important.

I have reliable sources in our government offices that are on stand-by to issue the needed backup documents to ensure no questions are asked during the processing and transfer of this fund into your account anywhere in the world.

The documents would all reflect in government?s records and archives for authenticity and to pass all possible scrutiny. The processing of the fund and its transfer would meet all international standards and rules. 

Upon conclusion of the transfer, you would retain 15% of the fund as your commission. Its also important to note that I want to invest in your country under your guidance and tutelage.

I guarantee successful and timely completion of this project within 10 days from the date I file formal pre-authorized debit (PAD) order with the bank to process the transfer.

For more details, e-mail me at suranasry@voila.fr

Yours sincerely,
(H/P: +447937444817)

Dear 
 
Apology for the delay in getting this news to you. I received a call and email from Mr. Franklin Minoru that he has sent your firm a partial payment to avoid further litigation. I was very pleased to hear this decent notification. In the light of this and because I have not sent you the retainer amount, I ask that you deduct your retainer and any cost accumulated so far. The balances from the amount received should be kept in your client trust account.  I thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with your firm and appreciate your counsel and hope we will be able to collect the remainder of the funds owed to me.  I await your acknowledgment.

"Juba Refugee Camp
Darfur Southern Sudan

Genocide in Darfur- Southern Sudan
------------------------------
----
URGENT SAVE OUR SOUL (SOS)MESSAGE
----------------------------------

Please Dear,

My Name is Ms Amir Orkidien Janda,36yrs,a Widow with my only daughter who is just 6yrs old now, I'm the wife of the late Dr Janda-the Medical Director of Juba Specialist Hospital which had been destroyed by the Sudanese President Omar El Bashir's Janja-weed troops.

My Husband was killed in March in a crossfire between the Janja weed Militia and the Rebel group (Sudanese Libration Movement Army-the SLM) led by Abdul Wahid El Nur in a Supremacy battle over who controls Juba. Unfortunately for the Janjaweed,Juba falled into the hands of the SLA.

The SLA are in Control of Juba now as i'm writing this message.Infact the Situation is very dangererous and is becoming more dangereous everyday, and the entire world has turned their back on we poor Civilians here, (especially on we Women and Children), very serious and dangereous genocide is going on here, and world Governments has refused to listen to our cries here more especially from we women and Children.

I was made the General Supervisor and Counsellor in this Refugee camp since June,which was when the Red Cross workers and other International Humanitarian Orginization ran out of Juba due to the heavy fighting going on here . I and my daughter(the only surviving out of my four children) ran to this Camp after the assasination of my husband who was the Personal Phsician to the former Vice-President John Garang who was assasinated through a Plane Crash masterminded and carried out by Sudanese President Omar El Bashir's Terrorist Squad ( the Janjaweed Militia).

This Camp is now a death field where women and Children die every hour, every day people die in hundreds here as a result of the situation in this Camp right now.We have serious shortages of Medicines, foods and no good drinking water, outbreak of deaseas and the worst of it all is that no access to bring in anything here.

The African Union Peace Keeping Force that was sent on a rescue Mission here has overpowered by the firepower of the SLA and the Janjaweed. Infact as it is now , Since they've been Surounded by the two fighting forces, they've been finding it difficult to make any move further after the suffered a heavy casualities in the hands of the SLA. Since then they're now fighting to get away out of this place.

Please i need an urgent help to take me and my only surviving daughter out of this place,electricity has been destroyed , roads destroyed , in fact there is a terrible systematice elimination of Christians going on here,telephones to this region totally destroyed.

It is at this AUPKF base we had this only Internet Access which is the only measure I?m using now to reach out to someone seeking an urgent help from an Honest person who can help me and my daughter leave this place as urgent as possible, for our hope is hopless here.

Here is the help i need; Please can you be of help to me in helping me buy a house in U.s.a Country? i will finance the purchase of the House and re-settle my life with my only daughter and start a new lease of life.

You will have a percentage commission interest on it for helping me ,In fact i will give you 15% of the purchase amount then immediately you complete the purchase and my daughter will find a way out to leave here by road through the Chad Basin Bush road part from where we will board a flight with our Refugee papers and meet you up.

Please kindly open this attached file on this message and see the situation we are in here or you log on to

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur

I'm waiting your responce urgently, as soon as i get your reply responce, i will send to you the full details of how i will send you the money to finance the purchase of the house and our plan to leave here.

You can contact me at my private Email Address: amirjandaa@gmail.com

Dear Sir/Madam

My name is Mrs. Judith Morris, a well known business woman. I am 69 years old, living in The Southern Part of Wales (United Kingdom). I am a successful business woman, owning some industries and companies, with some good stocks in various banks. I have spent all my life, investing in co-operate businesses and real-estates until the death of My husband and two of our beautiful kids in a ghastly car accident that took place sometimes in mid November 2003.

I must say that after the death of my family, I became a workaholic and very greedy with businesses and I presume that is what lead to my present ordeal. I stopped caring for people around and forgot how to live. However, my abuse of alcohol and tobacco increased and that lead to another problem when in early 2005, February to be precise, I got a letter for medical check up after a brief illness. After wards, I was told by my personal Doctor, that I have a cancer of the lungs, which according to her, would not allow me to live longer anymore. Ever since then, doing businesses has become uneasy as I am frequently in and out of the hospital for treatments, medications and Chemo-therapy sections.

In light with the above, I have since, started attending to a local church and presently made some substantial donation to the church. It actually felt good. Therefore, I have recently, consulted the pastor for a private counselling. I have told him my life story and we prayed together and after wards, he gave me an advice which is my reason of contacting you at this moment. His advice was this:

That the Lord will grant my soul mercy if I could help the needy people, homeless, orphans and less privileged homes that need this money. Including Business women and men for investment, whereby most of the earnings will be used in helping less privileged families and people. I have sold my companies, houses and other assets. Coupled with my bank accounts, a substantial amount at the estimate of (Â£1.200.000.00 GBP) One Million two hundred thousand British pounds starlings, is realized for this project.

Because of the above reasons therefore, I am writing this letter to people who really need help from me, to please contact me urgently, to discuss on his/her plans towards the use of the money. Please contact me Via Email [morrisjudith6@googlemail.com]

and let me know what you intend to do with the money and if satisfied, I will introduce you to my private lawyer whom I have set up all arrangements with for further discussions. As you know, I am a born again and so much with God’s work. Therefore, I would appreciate it a lot, if you are a God fearing human with a good heart.

Dear Friend,
I apologize to you for any inconvenience caused if this mail does not meet your demands, though I do not intend to embarrass you by the content of this very mail.

I am Barrister Ayo Maayo a legal practitioner here in Dubai, United Arab Emirate.This mail is written to solicit your assistance to present you as next of kin to my Late Client, who was a citizen of your Country but lived and did his business here in Dubai with his family. He was the CEO of Graphic Properties before his sudden death along with his family. Before his sudden death, he Had a fixed Deposit valued at USD$15.2million (Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) with a bank here.

Unfortunately he lost his life aboard Egypt Air Flight 990, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31, 1999 and left no clear beneficiary as Next of Kin. (http://cgvi.uscg.mil/media/main.php?g2_itemId=111953) The Bank has searched for the relatives for more than Six  years without any success and after Ten years, if no claim is made by any of the deceased next of kin, the money will be paid into the unclaimed accounts and embezzled by the corrupt bank or government officials.

It is against this backdrop that the bank has contacted me as the Late depositor's Attorney to contact and present to them my late Client's next of kin so that the deposit can be paid to him or her. This is why I have contacted you.

Upon your acceptance, I shall give you other details for the successful claim of the fund. I have secured from the probate registry, an Order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so I am assuring you that this business is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to reply me immediately, if not please disregard this email. Thank you very much for your anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt response.

Yours faithfully,
Ayo Maayo Esq.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

Dear Friend, 

I, am Mr. Philip Wall, The Finance Director, Royal Bank of Scotland, UK. I am writing this letter to ask for your assistance and full co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department with you. I am contacting you based on trust and confidentiality that will be attached to this deal.

I discovered an abandoned sum in one of our accounts, with holding balance sum valued at 12.5M (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) belonging to late Mr. Richard Ross. A real estate property magnate and an oil merchant, trading in the arabian gulf coast. He last lived at mill view hill, UK. He died on 31 October 2000. His account has been left dormant since he died. The account has no other beneficiary to claim the funds and his company has no idea about his account with our bank. This was all the clear evidence I got from my discret investigations I personally conducted over this account.

However, by virtue of my position as civil servant and member of this bank, I cannot acquire this money in my name. Therefore; My proposition to you, is to solicit your consent to present you as the Next of kin and beneficiary of this late late Mr. Richard Ross, So that the proceeds of this account valued a huge sum shall be approved and release for payment to you, and then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 35% for you, while 55% for me, 9% will be used as pay-back to both parties for all local and foreign expenses we might encure in this project. While the remainder shall be given to a reputable charity home because the money is owned by a deceased person. 

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act, funds will be released to you after necessary processes have been followed. If you are interested, please reply through email, so that I will give your futher details to proceed. Feel free to call me on my mobile phone.

Thank you for your understanding and willingness to corperate. I wait your urgent response soon.

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"Attn:

My name is Tony Nicolas, i am the Client Experience Officer at BB&T bank and account officer to late Charles Mills, the information reached us from Dr Gerrad From the fidelity medical center London, he informed us that late Charles Mills, collapsed and got unconscious while wanting to board the flight to United State from London, he was confirmed death after 6 hours.

I confirmed his death by the copy of the death certificate sent to us by Dr Gerrard.

On this regard, and as his account officer, i have been managing his account for over seven years now and i keep encouraging him to give me a name of his beneficiary{next of kin} in case of his death as he was a very wealthy elderly man, i have tried to get the name of his next of kin many times but he complained he don't have any family anymore.

Now i have a deal for you, there is currently $15.500 000.00 in his account which i am managing, and i can put your name on his file as the next of kin to the account since there is no beneficiary to the account, so that we can move the money to you, after then we can share the money %50 for me and %50 for you.

Dont worry about the paperwork as i will perfectly register your name as his next of kin and also send you the power of attorney certificate, so that we can successfully transfer the funds to you as your inheritance.

Indicate your interest by sending the below information immediately.

FULL NAME
RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
DIRECT PHONE NUMBERS
OCCUPATION
A COPY OF YOUR ID, DRIVERS LICENSE OR INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT.

I will be expecting your response, to help us process and transfer the funds to you without delay.

Thanks

well . . . i am back and checking in with you .
several things :
1 ) russell ' s mom passed away on friday . funeral is tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 4 : 00 p . m . in lubbock , texas . i am trying to make arrangements to attend , but it doesn ' t look probable due to flights .
2 ) i want your input on canceling the ny trip . i appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point . the remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course . i understand you will not be able to attend . it seems there is a general public belief ( from pec & keyspan ) that many enron employees will not have a job after this week . if they believe that , it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless . i want to make this call immediately . we have only spent an incremental $ 500 . 00 in the reviving of this event .
3 ) per my e - mail on 11 / 16 , i want to ensure that ena retains deirdre mccaffrey who is currently in the freight group . can we please move her into my group ?
4 ) a small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate . they want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further . your thoughts . . .
5 ) per our conversation last week , i have not received any package at my home .
5 ) is there anything productive i can do to help you ?

Dearest in the lord,

My name is Mrs Precious Ken am 69yrs old of age, I stay in new york city, USA.I am a good merchant, I have several industrial companies and good share in various banks in the world. I spend all my life on investment and corporate business. Along the way, I lost my husband and two beautiful kids in a fatal accident that occurred in November 5th 2015.After the incident that took away my husband and two beautiful kids, people ran away from me and now I realized that it's because of my greedy I don't care about people before. Later in the year 2016 I was sent a letter of medical check up from United Kingdom. My personal Doctor testify that I have a lung cancer, which can easily take off my life soon. I found it uneasy to survive myself, because a lot of investment cannot be run and manage by me again.

Presently I am in United Kingdom for treatment because I don't know how long I am going to stay again. I quickly call up a pastor/prophet to give me positive thinking on this solution. He advised and minister to me to share my properties ,wealth, to motherless baby/orphanage homes/people that need money for survivor and for future raising. So I made up my mind to follow the instruction from God. I am writing this letter to people who really need help to contact me urgently. I have made available preparation to share the funds in various banks in the world especially the Orphanage, Homeless and divorced women.Please contact me and stop weeping. probably the little you can get from me will improve your living and God will be happy with me and forgive me for not being kind to people before. Let me know what you really need the money for, and if you can still help me to distribute money to nearest orphanage homes, feel free to contact me or you give me their contacts so that I can reach them. Now I am so much wi

  Investing Some Money For Me
 Hello My Friend,
 My name is Mrs. Maureen Haughey. I am the widow of former Taoiseach of the  Republic of Ireland, Charles J. Haughey and daughter of former Taoiseach of the  Republic of Ireland and heir to de Valera, Sean F. Lemass.

 The Press has written a lot about unresolved mysteries and corruption  surrounding Charles’s dealings, but I tell you something,my Charlie was a good  man. I had to stand by him through the tribunal times, it was to do with what  I’m doing now. No one knew the details of all Charlie’s financial dealings but  me. I am the only one who knows about these monies and the other Ansbacher  accounts. You can read more about my charlie from: 
 http://www.ireland.com/focus/haughey/ITstories/story11.htm

 The Irish government thinks it can shave and reduce me to a poor widow but I  have the winning ace. A few years ago, when we weren’t sure if my Charlie would  be convicted, he kept some money in trust for me in a Financial instituition. He  did not deposit the money in our names so it will not be traced to us to enable  the past remain the past. The name on the account is Cedric de Vregille. The  amount he deposited in this name is €30,000,000 (Thirty Million Euros). 

 I want you, an honest person to come forward and lay claims to this amount,  moreover to use the funds as instructed by me. I will take care of all the legal  documents needed and have mapped out 10% of the total fund as your share, i.e  €3,000,000 (Three Million Euros) for your work in assisting me.

As soon as I  receive your acceptance for this work I shall give you more relevant details and  begin the documentation that will facilitate the release of the funds in your  name. Please reply me via my personal email: [mail_haughey@yahoo.co.uk]

 For my security and the sake of letting sleeping dogs lie, I strongly advice  that you keep our dealings confidential.
 Thank You.",1,1,"[""\u0120read"", ""\u0120accounts"", ""://"", ""\u0120http"", ""\u0120only"", ""\u0120about"", ""\u0120Ans"", ""\u0120other"", ""b"", ""acher""]","[0.0032072151695741714, 0.0021780045965657546, 0.0018507680235552782, 0.0018507663113028895, 0.001336874811356014, 0.0012660441786705421, 0.0010259868919789308, 0.0010259856488336724, 0.0010259856488336724, 0.0007495591086595535]","[""Mrs"", ""man"", ""am"", ""name"", ""about"", ""has"", ""Press"", ""unresolved"", ""stand"", ""documentation""]","[0.0009035072678536546, 0.0008582887214959809, 0.0008526671641680766, 0.0008439283884399165, 0.0004971673053547239, 0.00039001187733567373, 0.00021141736572720743, 0.00019227925466493506, 0.00014008823491697893, 5.475931002740844e-05]"

"" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does notrequire you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at m . o . c . marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number you must include your e-mail address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : w . o . w . incorporated po box 2527 victorville , ca 92393 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : m - tronics 32445 regents blvd . union city , ca 94587-4849 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from rkl international 3060 w . country meadow dr . tucson , az 85742 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : thunder tech . 202 lathrop st . south hadley , ma 01075 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this is the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that costs me pennies to produce and email . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or pyramid scam . at times you have probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever !

" From: Ms. Kelly Zhong  Request for Confidential Business Relationship I know that this will come to you as a surprise since we dont know each other before. For the purpose of introduction, I was a silent business partner to the Former CEO (Tony Hayward) of British Petroleum (BP), in United Kingdom. After due deliberation , I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as benefactor to the sum of US$45 Million (Forty-Five Million United States Dollars) equivalent because, I am currently in need of a silent foreign partner whose identity i can use to transfer the said sum. This fund accrued legitimately to me as commission from foreign contracts (Oil Spill in The Gulf Of Mexico) with British Petroleum during my time in active service through my private connections. The fund is presently waiting to be remitted from within Europe to any overseas beneficiary confirmed by me as a partner/associate/receiver. By virtue of my political position, I cannot acquire this money with my name. For this reason I took it upon myself to look for an overseas silent partner who could work with me to facilitate transfer of this fund for our mutual benefit, hence the reason for this message. What I am requesting from you is: (1) To be my silent partner and receive the funds as the sole benefactor to the contract amount which I shall secure all legal documentation here in U.K to authenticate my claim on your behalf. (2) Send me your full names and a private direct mobile number for easy communication under your control. (3) Receive the funds as the beneficiary, take out your commission after tax and keep the rest of the money until I arrive there to meet you after the transfer is completed. My proposal is that after you receive the funds, it would be shared as follows: (1) 25% to you as commission for your co-operation and assistance in facilitating the transfer from Europe to any of your nominated account, while the remaining 75% belongs to me. You will be free to take out your commission immediately after the money hits your country since my objective is to invest the money in a foreign Country; it would be appreciated if you could also help me with advice and direction (Consultation) on investing into profitable/lucrative ventures in your country for an additional 5%. However, this is optional, and if it is not convenient for you to further assist me with investing the money, we can end our cooperation after you make available to me my share of the money. this transaction, although discrete, is legitimate and the money will be transferred successfully with all necessary back-up documents showing legitimate source/origin of fund. The transfer will be effected within a period not longer than two weeks as soon as we reach an agreement and you furnish me with a suitable response indicating your interest for processing the transfer to my private email: ms.zhong.kelly@outlook.com.

"ok , i believe we have a consensus .
if i understand correctly our posting period for this capacity expires on monday at 5 p . m .
you should accumulate service requests for the capacity until that time . tie bids will be decided by a lottery .
if shippers ask you can explain to them that since this is newly posted capacity , we ' re posting it until 5 p . m . monday and will not award capacity until that time , and if requests for service exceed available capacity we ' ll award it based on the procedures in section 13 of the fts - 1 rate schedule .

subject : re : tw posting question - - urgent
per our previous decisions , we have utilized the provisions of section 13 for purposes of allocating capacity . therefore i agree with maria , that we would need to conduct a lottery if there are tie bids . i also agree that the reference to fcfs in section 1 is meaningless and should be eliminated . i would guess that that was there from inception , and has just been a non event . mary , put on clean up log . mk

i agree . however , does the first paragraph of the tf rate schedule say we will use first come first served ? i remember seeing something that struck me as odd but i don ' t have the tariff in front of me . thanks . df

subject : tw posting question - - urgent
importance : high
conoco did not exercise its right of first refusal on 20 , 000 of capacity on tw so it has gone back out on our ebb yesterday .
mindful of our posting guidelines for newly available capacity ( i . e . 5 days before we sell for a year or more , 3 days before we sell it for a term of 5 months - lyear , 1 day if we are going to sell it for 5 months or less ) , assume the following scenario :
march 19 : capacity is posted
march 21 : shipper a calls one of our marketers and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
march 22 : shipper b calls and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
march 23 : posting period ends ( assuming of course that the capacity got posted at 9 a . m . on march 19 )
questions : who gets the capacity ? what do we tell shippers a and b ?
we could say "" first come first served , "" but our tariff specifically states that we will not maintain a queue .
is the better answer that we accumulate service requests until the close of the posting period , then have a lottery ?
please let me know your comments . we need a consensus asap - - before we get that first offer . thanks .",0,0,"[""\u0120p"", ""onday"", ""\u0120understand"", ""you"", ""\u012055"", ""uesday"", ""sent"", ""\u0120correctly"", ""\u0120this"", ""\u0120them""]","[0.03191580384472613, 0.031915802557285176, 0.023055889165687318, 0.02212230676681576, 0.012849006672965898, 0.011643839337100344, 0.011643838013737608, 0.01117518453394603, 0.010678480326584396, 0.010678480060136589]","[""if"", ""you"", ""requests"", ""capacity"", ""posting"", ""monday"", ""consensus"", ""i"", ""for"", ""period""]","[0.06325557400556639, 0.03897117405613977, 0.03501202967364394, 0.03488515280084501, 0.027803026934786923, 0.024354040488315413, 0.02352152960809006, 0.02120088113689094, 0.02008699172828909, 0.01849576391318512]"

Dear Friend,

I apologize for sending this sensitive information via e-mail instead of a Post-mail, it is because of how urgent I need you to comply.
First, it will be my great pleasure to introduce myself. My name is Capt. Michael Tynes a U.S Citizen but currently in Afghanistan for peacekeeping.

On 21st December, 2012, my four colleagues and I were sent to a city in Afghanistan called Ghazni, this Ghazni was where the terrorist had their camp, when we got there, we had a big open fire but finally none of my colleagues died but we sustained some injuries as result to the open fire confrontation we had with the terrorists and we captured some of the terrorist while some escaped.

When we got into the building we discovered a huge amount of money that is worth 46,000,000.00 Million Dollars which they use in sponsoring and supporting their ugly activities by killing innocent souls. When we came back to our base the money was shared among us that fought the battle that nearly took our lives.
My share is 9,200,000 ( Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars Only), I traveled to London early last year and deposited my money in the bank there.

I want you to be rest assured that there is no risk attached and the funds in question can never be traced. Please if you have a solid background and idea of making good profit in any business sector in your country, please write me for possible business co-operation.

Get back to me with your business opinion, I really want to quit this military work because it is very risky for me. All my friends I shared the money with had left the base since ending of last year.

Enclosed herewith are the pictures of the money I am talking about and the weapons we recovered from the terrorists.
Please confirm to me if you do receive these pictures.

Best Regards,
Capt.

"PLEASE VIEW THE ATTACHMENT FOR MORE DETAILS.

Dear,

I am barrister Kingsley Moghalu, a solicitor at law and the personal attorney to late Mr. J. Markwell, a national of your country who used to be a private contractor with the Shell Petroleum Development Company, Lagos, herein after shall be referred to as my client. 

On the 21st of April 2008, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in an auto accident along Sagbama Express Road, all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives and since then, I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my client's extended relatives,This has also proved unsuccessful.
 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the internet to locate any  member of his family hence I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. 

Particularly, the Zenith Bank International where the deceased had an account valued at about $10.5 million U.S. dollars has issued me a notice to provide an INHERITANT or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over two years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this account valued at $10.5Million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money as thus 45% for me, 25% for you, 25% for Charity Organizations and 5% to cover up any expenses we might incur during the course of this transaction. 

I will procure all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Best regards,
Dr. Kingsley Moghalu",1,1,"[""\u0120family"", ""\u0120his"", ""\u0120hence"", ""\u0120repatri"", ""\u0120assist"", ""ating"", ""\u0120internet"", ""\u0120contacted"", ""\u0120member"", ""\u0120locate""]","[0.00015065138573260248, 0.00015064800301830688, 7.881638024867938e-05, 3.0419618730813683e-05, 2.8922052030831993e-05, 1.7611471955372598e-05, 1.2331663595526024e-05, 1.2064139120991643e-05, 9.440042372387003e-06, 8.443938914052045e-06]","[""April"", ""may"", ""that"", ""along"", ""Lagos"", ""to"", ""FOR"", ""hence"", ""kin"", ""you""]","[4.657626604364477e-06, 2.1417140447213255e-06, 1.9149445651826794e-06, 1.5957302379230697e-06, 1.5882686649106484e-06, 8.24741184913116e-07, 7.197643761152291e-07, 5.155660153003466e-07, 2.842748315872725e-07, 9.515421768803242e-08]"

 Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Miss Aisha Peterson, A Zimbabwean , Africa. I am writing to let you know I have an important business investment proposal I would like to discuss with you. To give you a small hint about the business.

 Please note:

 The main reason I have decided to contact you today is to seek your assistance to help me transfer my INHERITED MONEY DEPOSITED IN A SECURITY AND FINANCE COMPANY in MADRID-SPAIN to your country for investment. I am the next of kin to the DEPOSIT, but because of my lack of experience and the situation with me here as a refugee here in South Africa , I have decided to contact you and I will like you to stand for me as my Trustee and Representative to release the money from the Security company and transfer the money to your country.

 There will be a lot to gain from this business, so if you are interested, please do reply my mail and I will explain the details to you in my next mail..I will appreciate your quick reply.

Thank you.

My Dear,
 
I know this proposal letter might be a pleasant surprise to you as we don't know ourselves before. I am a Liberian born 30 years ago, now seeking asylum in Dakar Senegal under (UNHCR). I contacted you as a cause of my serious search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle such a confidential transaction of this nature.

My Late father former Deputy Minister of Finance under the executive civilian president of Liberia, but was assassinated by the rebels during the civil war and properties destroyed, but I narrowly escaped with some very important documents of (US$7.5M) Seven Point Five Million U.S Dollars deposited by my late father in a high financial company here in Dakar Senegal under.
 
However, I seek with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality like you to help me transfer this money pending when I will come over to your country for us to meet for investment of the money. Furthermore, I only want this to be done this way because your country is politically stable for any profitable investment, and I also want to add here that if accepted by you, you will serve as the original beneficiary of the money.
 
I feel confidence therefore, to introduce this offer to you. For your participation and all your assistance regarding this transfer, I have decided to give you 15% of the total money. Therefore, you are requested to furnish me back immediately you receive this request to transfer this money from Dakar Senegal to your country resident account or any account of your interest.
 
On commencement of this transaction I want to let you understand that the future of myself depends solely on this money. So please keep this business to yourself only to avoid raise eye brow of any third party.
 
I am eagerly expecting your urgent response.
 
Yours Sincerely,
David.",1,1,"[""\u0120now"", ""\u0120born"", ""\u012030"", ""\u0120years"", ""\u0120ago"", ""\u0120asylum"", ""\u0120seeking"", ""\u0120Liber"", ""ian"", ""\u0120before""]","[0.00023659725363055865, 0.00016935820426035073, 0.00016935508077343305, 0.00011689928746229136, 0.00011689833675821622, 0.00010040902222196261, 0.00010040777183938324, 4.546901024561386e-05, 4.5466360946496326e-05, 4.452060287197431e-05]","[""UNHCR"", ""born"", ""assassinated"", ""seeking"", ""a"", ""executive"", ""nature"", ""of"", ""the"", ""civilian""]","[5.912878451459592e-07, 4.2746848285220864e-07, 3.717256663188836e-07, 3.148067614384458e-07, 2.1062561102930608e-07, 2.0196915629291337e-07, 1.3723941978968184e-07, 1.1957821047836173e-07, 1.041453448220672e-07, 9.665967830527242e-08]"

i spoke with tom , and i completely agree and would like to hand all this eol
stuff over to you .
we need a sun server to take over the task . as it happens martin lin has one
in his office he ' s not using and up to the task . his box could serve sas to
enron , as well as handle listening in on the eol feedds and maintaining its
database .
martin ' s box technically belongs to ebs , but i think they are downsizing and
wouldn ' t mind giving it up .
in this way , you would have complete physical and administrative custody over
the data and any work you do with it . i needn ' t be involved , and you can know
your work is completely confidential .
i ' ll make sas and the eol software available , as well as the necessary ram
the server , at no charge . you just need to summon up some sysadmin resources
to finish the job . there is a fine unix guy named ben thompson who will
support you , i ' m sure .
task :
1 ) upgrade ram on martin ' s server

Dear Friend,

Good Day and compliment of the season.  I hope this massage meets you in good health. It has been a very long time. I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting the fund transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from London . Presently I’m in London for investment projects with my own share of the total sum.
Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist us in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact my secretary, her name is Mrs. Grace Ken ask her to send you the total US $1,500.000.00, which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So feel free and get in touched with my secretary Mrs. Grace Ken with your information and instruct her where to send the amount to you. Below is her email address contact:

Name: Mrs. Grace Ken
Email Address: gracekengk01@yahoo.com OR mrsgraceken@hotmail.com

Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the suffer ness at that time. In the moment, I am very busy here because of the investment projects which I and the new partner are having at hand. Finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to my secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with Mrs. Grace Ken and she will send the amount to you without any delay. I wait to hear from you ASAP notifying me if you have received you draft from her.
With best regards

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

Dear Sir
Greetings and happy new year with good faith; I am Mr Bah Zamba, banker and a personal financial adviser/friend to Mr. Mack (Eng.) a national of your Country. Mr Mack used to work with Petro-Ivoire in Ivory Coast as a Petrol-chemical engineer.

On Sunday, 2 February, 2003, Mr Mack, his wife and their only son and child were involved in Ikeja bomb blast in Nigeria. Mr Mack and his family went to Nigeria for a higher oil servicing contract he was negotiating with Shell Petroleum Company Nigeria PLC.

Unfortunately they lost their lives during their weekend outing for sight seeing. Since then I have madeseveral enquiries to locate any of my clients extended relatives but all to no avail. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.

I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and propertyleft behind in the Ivory Coast by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged.

Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about GBP=C2=A32.1million has issued me a notice to provide the next ofkin or have the account confiscated within the next few months. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over twoyears now.

I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of thedeceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of thisaccount valued at GBP2.1million can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money in the following ration: 50% to me and 40% to you. So far as I am here and concerned, I have already work out every strategic plans and going to arrange on how to obtain all legal papers on your names and address that is going to be used in getting the deal done without any risk to both sides.

I have worked out the modalities of this transaction. All I require is your sincere cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Please if you are interested to work with me with good faith and honesty, all you have to do is to send me the following:
(1) Your company name and address
(2) Your complete names
(3) Your direct contacts

I will use all these information to process and all the legal papers that back you up as the true next of kin for the fund account. I really hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

Please view these websites below to confirm what I am telling you.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2718295.stm

Eirween Sylers Juddy of the Kilo Company, 42 Commando Royal Marines of the British led coalition forces first in Iraq and currently in Afghanistan on Operation Enduring Freedom, based on the legislative and executive decision to withdraw all coalition troops before the end of 2014 and hand over all security to the Afghan Police, I have been approved for withdrawal and subsequently will be deployed to Falkland Island to serve out my deployment.
 
This circumstance have orchestrated this proposal and I will explain in details upon your acceptance.I have in my sight ,the sum of $13.2 million US Dollars which was recovered from one of our raids battling insurgencies, this people keep most of their money at home for evil activities which they normally get through illegal deals and donors.some of us did meet such luck and it happened that I went for this raid with the men in my unit and we agreed to part with sum potions of the money to compensate our self's for the sufferings we do undergo as soldiers in this evil land filled with suicide bombers, before making it known to the military authority.
 
So we agree to cut among us $13.5 million US Dollars cash each, though it seems quite an illegal thing to do by officers of our caliber, but considering the

amount of risk we run virtually every day which have led to loss of friends and  relatives including my brother in-law who was killed by a road side bomb leaving behind, wife and two kids, you will agree with me on parting with this little amount of the fund!
 
See website: http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1103032.html
 
I got this fund deposited with a Red Cross office here with an unidentified personel name of Miss Marie AVis, the fund is stashed in a box and I informed them that we are making contacts for the real owner whom is Miss Marie Avis,

clearly it is under my powers to approve who stands for the claim.I wish to use this money for charity purposes in Turkey, where we have high number of refugees and Sudan where we have currently the highest numbers of refugees displaced as a  result of war, you need to visit such places, I am not forgetting the displaced  in India. So I am willing to make you the next of kin to this Miss Marie Avis.
 
I want to invest the money on stock fish from Norway to support this refugees because based on my experience on battle ground in this places, they lack a lot  of fish and meat to add to their meager and unpalatable meals which they get in little quantity just to keep them living until God knows when the problem ends. Instead of allowing this terrorist to get the money and spend it on purchasing arms illegally from Russia and China it is better channeled to saving the world.
 
However I cannot move this money to the Britain because i will be in Falkland for years and the fund can not be moved in my name also because of my position as Service Men which forbids us from doing business while on active duty In a foreign land.so I need someone real, somebody that i can trust to move the funds in his names as the Beneficiary.
 
I will give you more details about this plan and how this will take off,  if your  are compelled to intervene.I have made a decision to give you 10% of the sum for your assistance while 90% will be for me, should you accept this offer. Contact me on [wwgrr1968@gmail.com]
 
I hope i am fair on this deal
 
Sincerely,
Cpl.

Dearest One,
I am Mrs. SADIA BELLO I am a widow being that I lost my husband,my husband was a serving director of the Cocoa exporting board until his death.
He was assassinated by the rebels following the political uprising, before his death he made a deposit of  Eight Million USA Dollars ($8,000,000.00) here in Ouagadougou Burkina Faso in one of the Security Company,he intended to buy a Cocoa processing Machine with the fund.
I want you to help me for us to retreive this fund and transfer it to your account in your country or any safer place as you will be the beneficiary and recipient of the fund which we will use for joint investment in your country.
I have plans to do investment in your country, like real estate and industrial production.
This is my reason for writing to you. Please if you are willing to assist me and my only son Boureima,indicate your interest by replying urgently.
Thanks and best regards .

They weigh 125 kg.You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that.It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles. You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage.Ignore him.

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42. (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve.But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.- Adam L.

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"Hello dear,
Good day,

How are you? I am Mrs. Clinton Raymond i came across your contact  in your country database results. Here is a clear situation of the process of this transaction. I  am representing a family that has given me the mandate to help  find a reasonable and profitable investment structure. They have just inherited huge fund from their predecessor, and they have  agreed to invest this money in the next 5 years for a good Return  On Investment (ROI).

I have been given authority to appoint a reliable international  investor to invest this fund so I need to be sure that I can  trust whoever I am presenting to the family. I am working hand in hand with a financial expert/compliance officer who will guide us through a certified and legal process. The amount in question is $12.5 million USD, I want to present you as a foreign investor  and authorize for the money to be moved to you in your country. You will be given full authority to handle the investment, I need someone I can trust and I need to be assured on my following  concerns;

Can I trust you with the fund?
Can you keep  it confidential?
Can you help me find a good investment for the funds?
What areas of investment will you recommend?
What % share will you want to take for assisting me?

This is a very legal transaction and everything will be  coordinated in black and white. The essence of confidentiality  cannot be underestimated because a lot of money is involved. Let me know if we can work together.

I await your early response to proceed immediately..

Warm Regards,
Mrs. Clinton

Our puppy Zac is ready to go, the puppy currently weighs 9lbs and is expected to stay between 27Ibs-30Ibs when fully grown. The baby is 10weeks old now and all the pictures on our website are current. Our puppies are very loyal, intelligent, eager to learn and very energetic. They get along well with children and other household animals, love to jump around and also follow their humans everywhere in the house and while they sleep quite a bit, the other hours are spent playing and eating! Every puppy goes with a handbook showing personality & lifestyle as well as feeding and toilet habits, vet history is also available on paper and goes with the puppy. Each puppy goes to their new home with a full puppy pack which includes pee pads,2 designer outfits, clothes, blanket, favorite play toys (toy bones and rubber balls), food menu, food & water bowls, photo album and some helpful information on video CD that will help facilitate the transition. They also come with a health guarantee paper that is still valid for 12 months which also covers a refund policy in case of any health defects noticed at your vet but however, every puppy goes with a certificate of good health so we are % 100 sure about their health. So, if you can promise to send us monthly updates and photos of the puppy so that we know how the baby is doing in your home, then I can have the puppy delivered to you by shipping . I can guess the question you have in mind right now, **Flying a Puppy: Is it safe? This question is often asked. We certainly wouldn't consider it if it wasn't. When we book a flight for a puppy it is only on safe, approved Airlines that have pet-safe programs that Follow USDA guidelines and there would be someone to look after the puppy on & off the plane, provide the puppy with food and water whenever necessary. Our puppies have always arrived safe and sound to their new owners and it is even better and more comfortable to fly a puppy on a 2-8 hours flight than to drive with that puppy especially the very young puppies and moreover, the puppy will have the same air as the pilot flying the plane & someone will be there to care & look after the puppy on and off the plane since the puppy will not have to stay in the cargo area of the plane but actually stays in the crew cabin. We are considering placing the puppy in your home but please note, before we proceed;
-We would not want our puppy to be used for any kind of breeding purposes.
-We would like the future new owners of our puppies to educate themselves more on how to care for a Corgi puppy (especially of this age). We hope you understand our concern. The shipping process normally takes between 6-18 hours to complete. So total for the puppy including shipping is $600re-homing fees plus $200 shipping making a total of $800.So if you are ready to welcome this baby into your family, then let me know so that we can proceed. The shipping process normally takes a couple of hours to complete though sometimes it could take a little longer but however the whole process hardly exceeds one whole day so once we receive your payment, we will prepare the puppy for shipment, find the most direct flight to your location then book the flight and then email you flight details including tracking number, departure and arrival times. We are willing to begin with the shipping process as soon as you can respond to this email with the following info required for shipping;

* Name of the closest airport,
* Name of receiver of the puppy
* Phone numbers (Cell & House)
* Address of receiver of the puppy (required for house delivery).

Man Claims He Was Held at Gunpoint for Eight Hours, Told to Sell Bitcoin
Jan 20, 2015

NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — An 18-year-old Bitcoin trader from New York says he was tied up and held at gunpoint by his roommate, who attempted to force him to sell his assets to pay for previous damages to their apartment.

Quentin Capobianco told investigators that his roommate Jesse Smith, a struggling lawyer at the time, tied him up and put a shotgun to his head over a financial dispute. The two had been working together on LocalBitcoins and BTCJam on income ventures. According to reports by DNAinfo, Smith held Capobianco captive with duct tape and zip ties, ordering him to sell stocks and bitcoin to pay for damages Capobianco had caused to their upscale apartment.

After allegedly eight hours of forced captivity, Capobianco broke free. He did not tell police whether or not he actually had sold his stocks and bitcoins in response to Smith’s demands, but did say that he found his way to the kitchen, grabbing a hammer to use as a weapon.

“I grabbed the hammer from the kitchen and hit Jessie three or four times until he was unconscious,” Capobianco told the police.

Following the attack, Smith was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Capobianco was then taken into custody, charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon, and held on a $250,000 bond.

Smith had just left his job.

“He was starting a new business,” Tony Wang, a clerk in City Sliquors, a liquor store that Smith frequented told the New York Post. “He said he was not going to work for someone else anymore, he was only going to work for himself.”

Whether or not the new business venture was tied to his co-trading with Capobianco on LocalBitcoins and their lending project on BTCJam is unconfirmed but considered likely.

“We are here for you with speedy and reliable service (just ask our repeat customers),” the two posted on their LocalBitcoins page. “You get your bitcoins on the spot, we wait four days for them. We have a LOT of Bitcoins and an even BIGGER demand.”

But the business apparently hadn’t been going as well as Smith had hoped, according to Wang.

“He’d buy champagne. He always dressed nice, but not the last few times. He said his business wasn’t good. He looked rough, like he had a lot going on,” Wang told DNAinfo.

Reports from the New York Daily News quoted a police source saying that Capobianco and Smith may have also been arguing over drugs, specifically heroin. Capobianco’s father denied any link in the case to drugs and a woman who identified herself as Smith’s ex-girlfriend also claimed there were no drug problems.

“They had a disagreement over money that Quentin owed Jesse,” the woman told the Daily News. “Quentin beat Jesse to death with a hammer with no less than five, six blows to the head, according to the surgeon who tried to save Jesse’s life.”

Capobianco’s lawyer, Ronald Bekoff, was unavailable for comment when contacted by Inside Bitcoins.",1,1,"["")"", ""\u0120him"", ""\u0120sell"", ""\u0120ordering"", ""\u0120apartment"", ""\u0120\u00e2\u0122\u0136"", ""\u0120An"", ""\u0120stocks"", ""\u0120actually"", ""\u0120sold""]","[0.003028135899214717, 0.0020826079120690173, 0.0020826079120690173, 0.0020826072867045943, 0.0016854977273603501, 0.0016075707156753714, 0.0016075672244119366, 0.0015632228821094473, 0.0015632228821094473, 0.0015632228821094473]","[""Bitcoin"", ""apartment"", ""Quentin"", ""Jan"", ""says"", ""An"", ""2015"", ""InsideBitcoins"", ""20"", ""roommate""]","[0.02371784530622493, 0.02123235879867788, 0.017517770754374107, 0.01655871453315172, 0.015292034591108306, 0.014340840224868066, 0.01422542942273136, 0.008273107761377376, 0.008211373279319535, 0.007743253657190716]"

"Dear Beloved,

Greetings to you in the name of God, My name is Fredrick Bakers Jr. I am a merchant of Oman nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I do not have anybody or family members to inherit this money after my death. Based on this, I have vowed to myself and to my God to donate this money to charity.

I am looking for a God fearing and reliable person from any religion and country who will claim this deposited funds before I die and use it to help the orphanage homes and hospitals after I have departed from this world.

I have distributed some of my money to charity organizations in Oman, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. I am therefore soliciting for your assistance to claim this money and use it as stipulated above. I am willing to give you 15% percent for your assistance and the remaining 85% will be for charity and less privilege. Please get back to me for more details.

Hope to hear from you soon.

God be with you.

Yours Faithfully,

"brad ,
i was extreamly busy yesterday . sorry for answing your question till now .
although i am not exactly sure how the system handle gamma , this is what i
think the system is doing :
curve shift = today ' s price - yesterady ' s price
p / l due to curve shift = today ' s market value using today ' s price curve ( with
everything esle the same as yesterday ' s ) - yesterday ' s market value using
yesterday ' s price curve .
so p / l due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order

enron is fine ( although i think we have to pay for the hyatt anyway ) .
?
good discount ( i have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the
weather desk ' s idea is probably different ? ) : ? for the one day , $ 1100 per
person . ? if you think that there will be ? around 10 people or more , then we
can offer a day rate , regardless of the number of people . ?
?
thanks vince

ps - of course when i announced that we were cancelling , people started

enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course . i think that they would be interested if they got a good discount .

day ( specific to what you feel will be of the most benefit ) , 2 days , hyatt

we just wanted to let you know ? that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather derivatives course ? ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong ? interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs ? up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the ? first day pretty easily , and thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just ? the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at
enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an ? option as well but the room might be on the
large side ) ? we would ? obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as ? well , but thought you may want to save some time .
i just wanted to give ? you some time to think about it . we will know where
we stand on final ? numbers by next ? wednesday .

"Hello,

Iâ€™m Mr. Alexander Howard, a Banker here in London. I went through your profile and i liked the concision of it.

I have decided to write you because I have a Â£1.5 million pounds business proposal for you. I discovered an over-draft of Â£1.5M which has been dormant in our bank for some years now but as my position (Collection Manager), there is no way I can have access to this fund without having a foreign business  partner to help me receive this fund.

The fund as i explained to you, its an over-draft which has been dormant for a long period of time here, this I discovered and has traced its origin and am finally convinced that it cant be pin-pointed to a specified account or to a client. I assure you, itâ€™s very legal.

So I decided to contact you because I believe you can help me out as a trustworthy person and I believe you can never betray me.

So as I said, if you are really ready to work with me, my lawyer will start working on all necessary documents as you know that I cannot come out front.

And based on percentage, I promise to offer you 40% as soon as you receive this fund.

I await your prompt response.

per our conversation today , transwestern pipeline and pg & e trading can wait until after the upcoming holidays to discuss pg & e ' s right of first refusal on the 61 , 000 mmbtu per day that is currently posted . in fact , section 13 ( h ) of transwestern ' s fts - 1 rate schedule indicates that transwestern could wait until july 31 , 2002 to notify pg & e trading as to the terms of the best offer . pg & e trading would then have two weeks to notify transwestern of its desire to match . i , however , suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in january .

"Greetings from Dubai ,

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Nizar AL Mallouhi a Kuwait National, currently Head of Cooperate affairs with a reputable bank here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I got your contact over the Internet as a trustworthy and reliable person.

Please pay attention and understand my reason of contacting you today through this email. I am the personal solicitor to a foreigner, Late Mr. Donald Heck, an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash {for more information about this crash and person you can contact this website} http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm

He is an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, Mr. Donald Heck, made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US $17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. You may read more about the crash on visiting this B.B.C News internet website.

If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for assistance.

As the Account Officer to Late Mr. Donald Heck , coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group , I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.

"As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.If a user has a line like:whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.comin his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
to be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger SA.Thanks in advance for any help.--

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

Dear Friend,
 
I am sorry for the embarrassment this mail might cause you, as we have not met before. I am Barr Guye Demba A senoir advocate of nigerian(SAN), and a solicitor at law, I am the personal attorney to Engineer Edward E'q national of your Country, who used to work with oando petroleum plc.
 
Hereinafter shall be referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 2002, my client, his wife and their children were involved in a car accident along Kano - Sokoto express Road while arriving from Easter Holiday to Warri Delta State. 
 
All occupant of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives, since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clientsextended relatives this has been unsuccessful. I came across your name and contact, while I was searching for Edward's relations, since my search did not yield the desired result, then i decided  to contact you for this project. I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and properties left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the finance house where these properties were deposited. Particularly, the finance house where the deceased Macpherson account valued $USD18 Million Dollars, last year issued me a 12 months notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the fund  confiscated,and this altimatum expires on August 25th 2007.
  
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating there latives for over two years now, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceed of this depositvalued at $USD18 Million Dollars can be released to you and then you and I can share the money, 50% for me 45% for you, and the remaining 5% will be for expenses and tax. Please, find picture of the funds as was taken by my client before it was deposited at the bank, because he made the money in one of the Oil project he had with our Oil Minister. 
 
I will disclosed also the family picture of Engr. Edward. This is just to proof to you that this  proposal is genuine. I also have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this business through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
 
Your telophone number may be  needed for easier and swifter communication.
YOURS FAITHFULLY,

Friendly greetings to you.

I work with a Corporate Financial Service Provider. We had a customer who deposited a huge sum of money with us and eventually died without any reference to a next of kin.In accordance with the Trust and Federal Laws, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, his investments with our Financial Trust shall revert to ownership of the government of the country of the said investments if nobody applies as the next of kin to claim the investments.

I am writing to you because I want to present you to stand in as the next of kin so that you and I can benefit from this investment equally (i.e. 50% for you and 50% for me).I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of the law.If this proposal is acceptable to you,

kindly indicate your full names, your private telephone, fax numbers and location where the money will be remitted. I will instruct you on the next step to take.

Sincerely,
Mr Elvis Williams.

"Good Day,

I am Capt. Danielz Rafaelz from The Monitor Group and Peace-keeping Mission, in Libya.I got your email contact through Internet email directory, decided to contact you.

On the 18Th day of February 2012, we were alerted on the sudden presence of some rebels camping in a suburb not too far from the Sahara Desert. After Immediate intervention, we captured twelve of the rebels and in the process of torture,they confessed and took us to a cave in which served as their camp and there, we recovered some boxes among which one box contains some US Dollars amounting to $6 Million US Dollars.

I therefore decided to contact you in the hope that you might be of help of receiving and secure the one trunk box containing the US Dollars in your country,for our mutual benefit.

Please, be mindful of the fact that I would prefer that you keep this confidential as I am still in the service and I do not want to lose my Job. If all is completed,I will be relocating to your country after my service in Libya. In which case, I would appreciate if you can help me invest the funds in a viable business venture over there.

However, I would be open to your candid suggestions, advise and concerns, above all to negotiations.

I shall await your urgent response to enable me give you the full details possibly to follow up this letter in a more comprehensive manner. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me, and I shall be very willing to answer you as honest as possible.

Firstly I must introduce myself as Michael Jose Pezzi an accountant in the Fondazione Di Vittorio Espana, established 1977 by the Multi-Million groups and now supported by United Nations Organization (UNO) and the European Union (EU), and conceived with the objective of human growth, educational, and community development thereby uplifting the standard of living of people. Below is the site.

After further investigation, it was discovered that some of the grant beneficiary did not claim their grant as their grant funds has been in our account for the passed three years. So, 7, 000 000.00 Euro (Seven Million Euro) is still unclaimed in our account and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is the Italians laws, at the expiration of 4 years the funds will revert to Italian Government treasury. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is re-organizing the ownership status of the funds in question and subsequently transferring same to you as payment of the Grants that was not claim by the recipient.

MODALITIES:
My duty is to ensure that the legal parameters for this transaction is by all means satisfied and within the ambit of local/international laws. My attorney is directly and entirely responsible for the facilitation of the beneficiary documents that will put you or your company in place as the rightful beneficiary of the said funds. Thereafter, you will be legally qualified to transfer the funds into your secured bank account for management purposes only.

Most importantly, you will be required to:
[1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
[2]. Receive the funds into a business/private bank account.
[3]. Invest/Manage the funds.

Once you have been positioned as the bonafied beneficiary, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and probate in your favor, hence the consummation of this transaction is 100% risk free.

Consequently, this transaction may commence without delay once we are able to secure your trust and partnership as you are adviced to give this transaction utmost confidential approach.

Hello Friend, 

I am contacting you again for a business contract offer from our company. Our company is incorporated in Canada, USA and Switzerland. 

There are some pharmaceutical raw materials that i usually purchase on behalf of our company from India when i was the company's purchasing manager. Presently I have been promoted to Canada Regional Manager and our company will no longer send me to India to purchase the raw materials because of my new position. 

However, the CEO of our company has mandated me to provide the supplier's contact information in India, but i'm yet to give him. I need a reliable business partner whom i shall present to our company's CEO as the supplier of these raw materials, to enable him to issue an official Purchase Order to the person's name, and also to allow the person to supply these raw materials to our company. This business contract is 100% risk free and i shall be advising you periodically on how to supply the raw materials to our company. The profit margin is lucrative, you and i will share the profit after each supply. 

Respond for more details if you are capable to handle this business contract. 

Regards, 
Dr. Ron Howard",1,1,"[""\u0120position"", ""\u0120purchase"", ""\u0120new"", ""\u0120my"", ""\u0120because"", ""\u0120Manager"", ""\u0120send"", ""\u0120longer"", ""\u0120no"", ""\u0120contact""]","[0.0002541916027698319, 9.487410330534815e-05, 6.607639143007925e-05, 6.607626283171e-05, 5.078099412371714e-05, 2.696165973616346e-05, 2.1182014553368776e-05, 2.118196017277271e-05, 2.0404593034208505e-05, 1.598457345204557e-05]","[""some"", ""information"", ""on"", ""share"", ""capable"", ""m"", ""him"", ""margin"", ""are"", ""There""]","[2.0087591094852973e-06, 1.9289980422415102e-06, 1.7386927724312474e-06, 1.713858854997821e-06, 1.4530530417403944e-06, 1.2244567321061058e-06, 1.00732467915402e-06, 8.610716507027078e-07, 6.729060107721896e-07, 8.974651116152757e-09]"

"OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.
INTELLIGENT/MONITORING UNIT.

Dear Sir/Madam,

We have been mandated by Federal Executive Council to review, investigate and ascertain for immediate payment any contract satisfactorily done and confirmed to be legally awarded. I have before list of funds, which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts has been identified either as ghost accounts, unclaimed deposit or over-invoiced sum etc.

Be informed that your contract file has been forwarded to my desk for vetting and payment.  This office is responsible for all external debt negotiation and payment.  The information we have shows that most contractors are dealing with some agencies or groups who claim to be Government approved agencies for contract verification and payment.  This information will guide you in your dealing with unscrupulo us individuals whose activities tarnish the image of this country.  Be also informed that the Central Bank of Nigeria has no power to remit any money outside Nigeria without the authorization of this office.

However, after the investigation on your contract file, which proved your claim to be Illegal and Unrealistic, I decided to send this confidential message.  I seek your understanding of the fact that no contract was genuinely awarded to you by the Federal Government of Nigeria.  That this fund you are claiming emanated through a deal masterminded by some retired Civil Servants and you have spend enormous resources to make it a success. For the fact that the original contractor has been paid long ago, they used their positions to obtain all the required documents to back up this claim.

â€œI have interest on this fundâ€￾ and have decided to seek for your confidential opinion on this matter.   I will write a favorable r eport on your behalf confirming your claims as now required by the Civilian Government.  This document will give you the power to sue Federal Government of Nigeria on further delay on this payment. I will work personally towards the successful conclusion of this lingering transaction, but this depends on your acknowledgments of this letter and our agreement on the sharing of the fund and your guarantee on my share getting to me at the end.

Furthermore, I am assuring you that under the new dispensation for foreign contract payment, I will make this payment a reality. , please let our dealings remain top secret.  For confidentiality and security reasons,reply through my direct E-mail: [drdanufot@live.com]. I expect to hear from you within five (5) day of receipt of this message in acknowledgment of this message, otherwise I will believe you are not interested and recommend the cancellation of this payment out rightly.

"Dear  Friend,

I write to seek your co-operation as my foreign partner and your assistance to enable me own properties and invest in the economy of your country. I apologize if this letter does not suit your personal or business ethics.

My name is Mr. Martin Logo, a lawyer and personal confidant to a dead depositor of Gold and huge amount of money with a reputable bank here in my country. I trusted and believed to confide this confidential business suggestion to you and I am making this venture proposal to you in strict confidence. This is an overdue unclaimed fund totaling to the amount of US$19.5M, and Gold worth about US$30M, belonging to one of my foreign clients who is now deceased. I want to make the transfer to oversea with the assistance and co-operation of a company or an individual, via a reliable Bank Account as the Foreign Business Partner to the deceased.

Although the world is very small place and hard place to meet people because you don't know who to trust or believe, but as I have developed trust in you after my fasting and prayers, I made up my mind to confide this confidential business suggestion to you. If you will like to assist me as a partner then indicate your interest after which we shall both discuss the modalities and the sharing percentage. All other information to facilitate the remittance of the funds will be revealed to you in due course. If you are not interested, please also indicate so to enable me contact other foreign partners who might be interested to work with me.

A swift acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter and early establishment of position will be appreciated.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

with calger leading the likes of parquet etc they can make $ 100 mm plus - without him no chance . i think it ' s sort of indirect p & l .
i think we are close enough i ' d put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too . harry , orlando and zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent .
let ' s not stick to 30 - let ' s do 33 putting miller , deffner , foster , zipper , ermis and aucoin in . daliney ' s note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list .

i would put them all ahead of bernie however i have no data points apart from p & l on nothing with frank so i can ' t comment on him . . not huge differences in order , apart from your slant on canadians ! the main issue with yours is calger behind benson and zufferli ( and even maybe dana ) , he ' s a future leader of this organisation . your ordering is very p & l based .

only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected

Dear
 
I am the Principal Attorney charged with the responsibility of managing a particular investment account for a resident foreigner who died, leaving in my care, a sizeable amount in investment just when we were concluding the investment release procedures. Just recently, we discovered a copy of the Last Will and Testament of the deceased in our archives and a name appeared on the Will as a next of kin and beneficiary of the inheritance, hence, I am contacting you to that effect.
 
The peculiarity here is that our benefactor shared the same surname with you and as such, with proper co ordinations between you and I, I can do the necessaries with the Last Will and Testament to validate you as the beneficiary, thus satisfying the mandatory legal requirement of Beneficiary/Next of Kin Verification. I therefore need your assistance to facilitate all actions in securing the investment before it is declared serviceable by the custodian, as they have already issued a mandatory formality notice for me to provide the beneficiary of the investment with proof, or have the fund confiscated and this should expire within 30 days.
 
The followings are my specifications for your consideration and immediate attention as all we need to do now in response is to confirm your beneficiary status as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of the investment, valued at US$7,750,000.00 (Seven Million Seven Hundred And Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) will be released to you before it is rendered serviceable. Please re-confirm the following as required:

1) Your full name.
2) Address.
3) Phone, Mobile and Fax if any.
4) Profession and Age.
 
As soon as I receive this information, the revalidation and re confirmation processes will commence in your favour.
 
Sincerely,
Peter Hunt (Principal Partner),

sorry for the confusion .
this is a second tanker on which very few details

to provide some information for joe sutton before
his departure for paris this ( tuesday ) afternoon .
there is no dash on this 2 nd tanker yet . i asked dave gorte

subject : re : lng may 19 decision
john ,
this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .
1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash
and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island
project ( please , see point 2 ) .
2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest
( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island
transaction . the next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :
a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term
contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the
long - term
contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are
setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .
b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension
option of
5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we
have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for
such a long tenor . this is
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread
and
i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .
one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the
first
5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .
c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market .
d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island
deal
( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .
long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail
that
correlates very well with brent .

i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .
anyway with greg moving to his
new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the
eastern hemishere plus lng .
i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for
lng and lng ship values . i also understand
that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far
away ) . anway i understand this
is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you
please let me know where you stand now ?
i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .

I am Mr. Madhusha Dilhaan, an auditor with African Development Bank (ADB). There was an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently, this funds will go down the drains, into the hands of either the board of directors of this bank or the funds may eventually be discovered by the government as a dormant fund in the forthcoming audit by the Nations auditors. They will confiscate or send it into the government's treasury account. The question now is who is the government and where is the treasury? These are human beings like you and I. The owner of this account is Mr morris Thompson,a foreigner,and a miner at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died in 2000. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account. The amount involved is Ten Million, Five Hundred and thirty Thousand United States Dollars.10,530.000.00
 
I am only contacting you, as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account and foreign beneficiary because the money is in US dollars and the real owner of the account Mr morris Thompson, is a foreigner too. I only got your contact address from my secretary who operates computer; with believe in god that you will never let me down in this business so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately.
 
I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you later, if you will be able to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in our life.
 
With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing and investment. I will also use my position and influence to effect legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance documents from the ministries and foreign exchange department. But  only  it  will  cost  you small  money as  to procure  such back  up   documents  from  the  ministries  inconcern.

SEVEN HOME BOXER PUPPIES
Because we sell the best Boxer puppies around! We are a family of 7 who love our Boxer puppies like they are a part of the family. We would love to be a blessing in helping you find the perfect Boxer Puppies for your family.

Seven home Boxer puppies is veterinarian owned and operated home based breeder of the highest quality Boxer Puppies . We strive to produce a small number of exquisite Boxer puppies each year so that others can discover what we have known for years.

Boxer puppies are the sweetest most lovable dogs available. They can melt your heart with those big loving eyes. They learn quickly and are always eager to please you, their best friend. Boxer puppies are an attractive and eye catching breed. Their bodies are small but muscular and heavy boned, giving them their characteristic appearance that is so desirable. They average 18 to 24 pounds, so are small enough to fit into most living situations. They love car rides, leash walks, and just spending time with you.

Let us guide you to the perfect addition to your family. We can counsel you on what personality of puppy will best fit your lifestyle. Check out our available puppy page.

Our veterinary expertise is valuable in assisting you with the well-being of your new addition. We are always happy to give health advice and be a resource of knowledge to the friends we’ve made over the years.

For those interested in breeding, we have everything you need. With 19+ years in the veterinary field focusing on reproduction, specifically artificial insemination, semen collection and processing. Our ability to help you successfully breed your female is a huge advantage for you. Check out our stud page and see what we have to offer.

What makes Seven home Boxer Puppies different from other pet stores is that we really do care about our puppies – how they’re cared for, where they come from, and where they go. Seven Home Boxer Puppies reserves the right to refuse the sale of a puppy to anyone whom we feel cannot provide an appropriate home, and we never let our puppies go to unfit homes for the sake of a quick sale. For example, someone who works 12-hour days with very little free time on their hands would not qualify to purchase a boxer or tiny toy puppy from our boutique, as these puppies require a great deal of care in the first few months of life. For the clients who do qualify, we provide a 45 minute orientation on how to care for their brand new puppy. We do not ship our puppies in cargo – ever. It’s a dangerous practice, and no amount of money is worth the risk. We are very selective about which breeders we will and will not work with; we do not support puppy mills. Our puppies are raised in homes, mostly local to the Idaho area, where they and their parents are treated as family and very much loved. We offer 24 hour emergency customer service, and we follow up with each and every one of our clients after they’ve taken their puppy home. When you purchase a puppy from Seven home Boxer Puppies, Puppies & Boutique, you can rest assured knowing that you’re bringing home a healthy and happy puppy, and that we’ll be here for you every step of the way.   https://sevenhomeboxerpuppies.com/

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,
claudia

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

This is to officially inform you that the Imf via the United State Department of Treasury have approved the sum $2,500.000.00 (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand United state Dollars) has been issued as a compensation payment for all the short listed 2000-2013 scam victims whose email address was recovered during the recent internet probing and investigation process. Your email address was found among the list so we are in no doubt believed that those syndicates must have collected monies from you through their dubious criminal ways.

It was on these very recommendation that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in conjunction with the United State Government after series of meeting held came up with a sanction to all West African countries to compensate all the foreign victims with a payment benefit of $2,500.000.00 (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) each in order to restore the Global Economy to the enviable standard of respectability.Please note that upon receipt of your response we will process your Payment through the United State Department of Treasury, so if you like to receive your fund, contact the director in charge of the compensation payment at Department of the Treasury Mr Kenny Ivy with the following information;

1. Full Name:
2. Phone Number:
3. Address, Occupation, Position

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .

Hello dear,
I am writing to you with due respect and equally with heart full of tears and sorrows since we have not known or met ourselves previously. Please, i mean no harm to you only that i am in a desperate situation and need urgent help. After going through this mail, it will be your decision, whether to help me or to leave me to my faith, but whatever you decide, bear in mind, i am in trouble and need your help.

I am asking for your assistance after i have gone through a profile that speaks good of you. I will be so glad if you can allow and lead me to the right channel towards your assistance to my situation. I will make my proposal well known if i am given the opportunity. I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you.

Anyway, i am Hazina Samuel, 21 years old girl, the only daughter of Dr. Samuel K. Doe, my father is now late, I lost the entire member of my family during the crises and i was lucky to be in burden school when the war started. My late father died during the last crisis in my country (Liberia)West Africa. He was one of the high officers standing against the  leadership of formal President,Charles Taylor who is now in exile after many innocent souls were killed, My father was unlucky to be among those that were killed by the rebel.

The main reason why i am contacting you now is to seek for your assistance in the area of my future investment and also for a help hand over of some huge amount of money in my possession. This money $6,000,000:00 (Six million USA dollars) was deposited some years ago by my father, he made me the sole beneficiary. Please, i am now asking you to stand on my behalf to make this claim to stand as my partner oversea and in time of the investment as well.

As i have mention earlier i will make the procedure to this issue to be well known to you if you give me the opportunity to do so. Please attach your direct contact information as you reply to me.

I am Sergei Lavochkin former associate and personal assistance to Platon Lebedev director of Group MENATEP, a holding company with diversified assets of $20 billion, primarily in oil and gas, mineral fertilizers, telecommunications and information technologies, and banking and financial services. Group MENATEP was the majority shareholder of YUKOS.

www.khodorkovskycenter.com/...lebedev/about-platon-lebedev

The Russian businessman was arrested in 2003 on charges of fraud and sentenced to eight years in a Siberian prison colony in 2005. A new trial of him and his Yukos partner Khodorkovsky Russia richest man began in March last year after prosecutors laid fresh charges against them.

I am presently exile in one of the leading European countries due to threat from president Dmitry Medvedev and Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin recently to arrest relatives and former associates of both men, contact me for an oil and gas investment offer as I intend settling down and relocate my family I can be reached on my private web mail (lavochkin_sergei@yahoo.com.hk) free Emails aren't always secure, and they may be intercepted or changed after they've been sent An arrest has been applied to the territory where we live there are no men there, no complete families,"" ""The people who lived in the settlement have scattered to different countries, and two of them are in prison.

Political analysts believe the Kremlin wants to ensure Khodorkovsky and Platoon Lebedev is not released in the run up to the 2012 presidential elections.

Platon Lebedev's case is politically motivated, and his arrest and prosecution were widely perceived to have been a warning to Khodorkovsky, as well as a means for the government to facilitate the expropriation of Russia 's oil and gas industry. Lebedev's ordeal has been replete with violations of the most basic human rights.

If convicted, the tycoon could spend another six years in jail after his current sentence expires in October 2011,hence he wants me to invest his funds in a foreign land and also ensure I personally handle his finance and family until his ordeal is over.

Do contact me and let me elaborate on the investment proposal.

Thanks in anticipation,
Sergei Lavochkin

ZDNet AnchorDesk NewsletterTUESDAY, JULY 16, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey

the results of our survey confirmed for the management committee and me the great things you feel about enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move enron forward . the following are some of the things we ' re doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified . keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback .
now , here ' s what we ' re going to do based on your feedback .
stock price
we are all concerned about our stock price , which has declined significantly this year . the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include :
- - - a decline in the overall market and economy ;
- - - certain enron - specific issues , such as california , india and recent management turnover ;
- - - a "" meltdown "" in the broadband sector , which may have been as much as $ 30 - $ 40 of our stock price at the high ;
- - - lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter ' s high ; and
- - - concerns over the pace of energy deregulation .
these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution , wholesale and retail businesses . very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth , and future earnings growth , as has enron . we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors , our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve .
- - - over the past month , we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts , reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses .
- - - we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money .
we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward :
- - - mark koenig , executive vice president of investor relations , will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions . he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions .
- - - greg whalley , mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees , which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide . watch for these events .
the prc
the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy . understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors , which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership , and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives . nevertheless , we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern , and we believe we can improve , refine , streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone .
therefore , we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to year - end :
- - - effective immediately , relative performance discussions will occur annually at year - end . however , business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently .
- - - the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron . business units will be asked to identify only their top 10 % and bottom 10 % performers for review by enron ' s office of the chairman annually at year - end .
- - - we will continue to use the pep 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees . we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year .
- - - finally , we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes .
in the november issue of enron business , we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process . in addition , there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year - end .
employee morale
we believe the stock price , our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale . additionally , some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns . effective immediately , we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources ( hr ) rep .
- - - we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations ( er ) that will report directly to the office of the chairman . cindy olson will head this function . more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days .
over the long term , we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles .
- - - we will encourage vice presidents and above , as well as other current and emerging leaders , to complete executive impact & influence training . these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people .
- - - additionally , we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate ! , which will be rolled out immediately . communicate ! is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video , voice mails , e - mails and meetings notes , to analyze user performance based on a participant ' s responses and actions .
external reputation
we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year . the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees . we recognize that as enron ' s ambassador ' s in the marketplace , the more you know about our strategy , performance and challenges , the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company . to ensure you are better informed :
- - - we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron . in addition to our existing communication efforts , like e - mail messages and internal publications ebiz and enron business , we will post a q & a on current issues on the enron intranet at home . enron . com . this will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers .
- - - as we said before , greg , mark and i , as well as members of our management committee , will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges . look for these to start in mid - october .
integrity & respect
i believe , as i said previously , we need to reinforce our core values , particularly integrity and respect . from what you have told us in this survey , you agree .
- - - enron ' s values will have more importance in each employee ' s evaluation and feedback . we ask that all employees , regardless of level , hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis . we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers .
- - - we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional , specific feedback on employee issues like ethics , integrity and individual concerns . if you would like to participate in these focus groups , please send an e - mail to cindy olson .
- - - periodically , i will host a special feature column in enron business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results .
finally , i give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding enron ' s strategy and challenges , and listening to your concerns and ideas . but we would ask for your commitment , too . we need your dedication to enron and its values , as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long - term success . we will conduct another employee survey early next year . please continue to send me your feedback and let ' s continue to work together and keep enron one of the best places to work in the world .",0,0,"[""\u0120were"", ""recent"", ""<s>"", ""\u0120lay"", ""\u0120line"", ""\u0120tell"", ""\u0120responded"", ""\u0120many"", ""\u0120plan"", ""\u0120image""]","[0.051281548725347646, 0.031280709578595634, 0.031280705114113516, 0.025678937478536078, 0.025678937478536078, 0.02567893692624542, 0.011351827458042862, 0.011351824321536697, 0.011351260409014685, 0.0018077399572749052]","[""enron"", ""first"", ""in"", ""you"", ""survey"", ""issues"", ""the"", ""to"", ""ask"", ""want""]","[0.43245858003002113, 0.13975679158674037, 0.08023101187058868, 0.07767001694952938, 0.07203646740100556, 0.07072050275658043, 0.0622575709680724, 0.05976240575930884, 0.0421068933636567, 0.018465966448684437]"

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

Subject: Cherished One

Cherished One,

My name is Mantsika Matooane an Independent Non-Executive Director, at the Security Developments and Finance Center located in South Africa. I wish to interact with you based on a confirmed discovery. A payment ready in a safety vault the owner is - Mr. Kevin Ash (Aged 53) he died in a terrible accident in a West South Africa city in 2013.

At my desk I discovered a finance policy starting at the release of such payment to a benefactor through an application as next of kin is a possible transaction. After his death, the bank has been expecting a possible beneficiary, The most reason i discussed this event personally is that our institute has exploited all possibilities in order to contact his relations and it failed.

However due to recent crises, lots of reforms occurred in the South African Finance Department. Any requisition process is disposable in a duration of (5 years) according to terms and conditions. The Bank of South Africa has approved to process release of this funds to the best possible inheritor, Failure to respond to this ultimatum involves a legal action impounding this funds as unclaimed (Meaning it would be transferred to Government Finance).

I have decided to contact you, I want you to know that I am a senior member in this office. I have all classified information linking to the successful release of this funds. I swear by the court of law to be dedicated in making sure that I send all possible documentation ready to process the approval and release of these funds.

Upon your acceptance with full co-operation, I decide the percentage gain that a total 40/100 including banking information be disclosed to you, and total 60/100 goes to me.

Please note that my conversation is private only my husband is aware,  Barr.. Joseph Matooane We strongly advice you communicate first with me via my husband’s contact details. Immediately he will get in touch with me, I would be able to inform you how it could be concluded.

In brief, my concern is now your ultimate honesty, co-operation and confidentiality to ruling this transaction. I PLEDGE that this is a legitimate finance that would legally protect you from any breach of law.

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

db4 development files at least, and once everything installed you'll need
to initialize your rpm database.If you need more help, I suggest you join the rpm-list@redhat.com by

have renamed it, but they didn't). It's in the same
redhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the
redhat-release package to find out which version is on the server. 
Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2.If you're using GNOME2 from the beta, I'd upgrade as there were some
important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out
for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again
incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).gary_______________________________________________

"Hi,

How are you?. My name is Sheila and I am working with a Humanitarian Aid Organization in Al-Anbar province of Iraq. Our main work is to establish adequate Educational institutions and health care centre for the internally displaced people in the rural areas.

I got your address from a universal contact directory hence I decided to write to you personal for an urgent discussion if you don`t mind.

My main reason for writing to you is that I need your help urgently. I am planning to resign from my job due to security risk in this area therefore I want to know if you would be interested to help me secure some funds which I want to move out of Iraq as quick as possible The total amount is 2.7 million USD (TWO MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS) and I need a reliable partner out side Iraq who can assist me in the process therefore I want to know if you can be able to help me secure this money in your country on my behalf until I come and collect it back with out having any problem with you.

Actually I do not know you in person to trust you enough but I hope you can prove to me that you are reliable, and can handle this transaction competently. There is no risk involved because I will arrange how to move the fund to your country through a very safe way but Can I trust you?. Are you going to keep this money intact for me until I come and get it back from you?.

I will offer you 15% of the total amount if you would accept to assist me in this process and also I would like you to suggest any profitable venture in which I can invest some part of the money so that I will have a source of income after my resignation.

Thanks and have a peaceful day. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

 sincerely

"Dear Friend.

I hope that this e-mail reached you in the right frame of Mind.

I am Mrs Rama Djirama , I am suffering from cancerous ailment,When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 7.5 Million USD which were derived from his vast estates and investment in capital market with his bank here in BURKINA FASO. Presently, this money is still with the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I have limited days to live due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from. Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family, and me I have decided to donate this fund to you and want you to use this gift which comes from my husbands effort to fund the upkeep of widows, widowers, orphans, destitute, the down-trodden, physically challenged children, barren women and persons who prove to be genuinely handicapped financially.

"Dear beloved
Greetings and peace be upon you! As I said in my e-mail before, my name is Mrs. Margaret Rahmann. I have decided to donate my cash inheritance from my late husband (Mr. Dymphna Rahmann) for charity projects because of my terminal illness.

I decided to use my cash inheritance for this noble charity project because my marriage with my husband ended childless. I was 58 years old, 2 years ago, when I was first diagnosed of this cancer, which occurred shortly after my husbandâ€™s death, a situation that plunged me into hypertension and eventual partial stroke. In my present state of health, life is meaningless and hope dims every passing moment for me. At the thought of my battered and shattered existence, I am usually overwhelmed by despair and gloom.

It is mainly my hopeless and helpless situation that prompted me to decide on this project to better the lives of the less privileged or disadvantaged out there, as my own last token of contribution to humanity. I must confess that I was really touched by God to do this.  I decided not to donate this money to anyone I know around, because if I did, upon my death, my husband's relatives will engage such beneficiary in legal battle, claiming  my action was without their consent  and as such 'null and voidâ€™. They may attempt to use their influence to pervert the course of justice and recover the donation; a thing I hate to imagine! My husband's people are vicious and wicked such that it'll amount to betrayal of my late husband if I let them access and enjoy the fruits of his hard labor after all their misdeeds against their late brother. God forbid that I will do a thing as cowardly as that.

You can now see the combination of factors that prompted the donation/charity initiative.

What I want you to do is to invest the money in any area of business you have relevant experience and knowledge to manage, which is viable and profitable, and at the end of each year, you should disburse 50% of the profit for charity purposes and put 35% back in the business for expansion, leaving 15% for yourself as compensation.

This way, the charity funds will not only be sustainable to serve many generations but will generate employment and empower jobless persons around. This is my vision and that is the way I want you to handle this project without fail. I want you to guarantee me that you will commit and devote yourself for this task and sincerely and honestly disburse the resources I am giving you to accomplish it. For no reason should you given in to the temptation to divert the funds into self-serving purposes. As you discharge this assignment with sincerity and honesty, God will surely reward you His own way. Please, because I do not want my husband's relatives, who spy over me, to know of my latest decision/action (at this stage) and for health reason(s),I shall not entertain phone calls and Conversations.

Again, I want you to know that this money was completely sealed in a box and deposited in a private security finance company and the Security  finance company is ready to move the sealed box  by  diplomatic immunity delivery through diplomatic channel to your country so that you as the new beneficiary will  receive it in cash as the beneficiary after which you  can now put the money in your  bank account so just contact them now.

I want you to know that any parcel sent by diplomatic immunity courier delivery services is covered with diplomatic immunity and cannot be search or scan at the airport or any port of entry because of the immunity as the diplomat will do all the diplomatic clearance on arrival at the airport and you will pay all the official governments fees according to the international diplomatic regulations so I can assure you 100% that the parcel will be delivered directly to your house or any place you want to receive it without any problem.

All top personnel's, High rank officers, Government official/politicians only moves fund out from here and around the world through diplomatic immunity courier delivery because it is the only guarantee source of moving huge amount out without any question from any Authority.

So if you are sure  that you will use the donation as I have directed, please provide me the following requirements for onward delivery to the security company with letter of introduction and authorization letter to change the beneficiary to your name and request for them to move the sealed box to your country for you to receive it and also  I need scan  copy of either your driving license or international passport:-

Address:
Nationality:

Re: Funds.

I write to request your co-operation in a high yield business transaction to raise funds to assist persons in need, the sick and the homeless.

I hope to use my position as an auditor and the facilities at my disposal to move funds abroad to your account for onward sharing as stated below.

When we conclude the transaction, you will personally keep 30% of the funds and I take 30% while you invest 20% in real estate or any viable business joint venture you may recommend in your country. 20% goes to this charity.

If this is possible with you, then treat as urgent and reply.

"Good day and greetings to you in the name of the Lord. By way of introduction, I am Ms. Stella Martins. A 17 years old student in the University of South Africa, Pretoria. I recently lost my beloved dad, about a month ago who left behind my aged-mother, my younger brother who is 14years old and I.

He was a very wealthy and prominent local king of the Zulu tribe. He left behind a vast estate which has become a subject of tussle between his immediate family and us. My younger brother and I are the only ones that knows the actual value of his wealth through the Director of the Security Firm he left it with. The total sum is about US$2,000,000.00 (Two Million United Sates Dollars) and I don't know how and what to do in investing this money somewhere abroad so that my father's wicked kindred will not take over what rightly belongs to us (just as they have confiscated the ones here) and also threatened to kill us with voodoo. That is why I am elated when I saw your contact and feels that you can help us take custody of the funds from the Security Firm  before I join you in your country considering my young age.

My aged mum, younger brother and I, sincerely need your help in securing the money from the Security firm. Base on your response, I will furnish you with more details on how we can proceed. We are willing to give you 20% of the total amount and another 10% interest of Annual Income for handling this business and also investing the funds on our behalf in any profitable venture that you will strongly have absolute control over.

Please, please and please, we are counting on your next favourable response so that we can proceed. I look forward to hearing from you soonest via my direct email address: stellamartins02@outlook.com

"Greetings

I am Mr. Phan Yin Tong, and a personal Accountant working with one of the Major bank here in asia . It is with good spirit of heart I opened up this great opportunity to you. A deceased client of mine that shares almost the same name as yours died as a result of heart-related condition on March 12th 2005. His heart condition was due to the death of all the members of his family in the tsunami disaster on the 26th December 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia where they all lost their lives. More infohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami)

There is a draft account opened in my bank in 1999 by a long-time client of our bank, a national of your country. He was a CEO/Engineer and business man here in Royal Kingdom of Cambodia, before he passed away on the March 12th 2005, leaving nobody as the next of kin of his account after his death.

I want to present you as the beneficiary of the deceased. I will use my position and influence in our bank to make sure they release this money to you for us to share. If I wait for days and if I do not hear from you, I shall look for another person. Kindly get back to me for more details.

"From Mrs Hilda Davis
Hello dearest one my name is Mrs hilda davis from Australia. I am married to Dr davis who worked with our Embassy in cote d ivoire for a period of 8 years before he died  We were married for 13 years without a child before he died after a brief illness Since his death I decided not to marry again due to my religious belief  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$9.5m(Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand United State American dollars ) with a Bank in cote d ivoire. Presently this money is still in the custody of the Bank in cote d ivoire. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Four months due to cancer sickness.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this money to churchs, organisation or good person that will utilise this money the way I am going to instruct here in.

I want you to use this money for churchs, Charity organisation, orphanages, widows and other people that are in need. l took this decision because I don''t have any child that will inherit this money . Moreover, my husband relatives are not close to me since I devolop a Cancer problem and it had been their wish to see me dead in order to inherit his wealth since we have no Child. These people are not worthy of this inheritance. This is why I am taking this decision. As soon as I receive your reply I will give you the contact of the Bank in cote d ivoire where this money was deposited. I will also issue a letter of authorisation to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you to always put me in prayer.

Any delay in your reply may give me room to look for another good person for this same purpose.  Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here in. Be noted that this transation will cost you a little money to get the changing of ownership certificate of the fund to your name,30% of the total money will go for your own use and your family including the expenses you will made while the rest of 70% will go for the churchs, Charity organisation, orphanages, widows and other people that are in need.

Hoping to receive your response soonest,at (mrsshilda@gmail.com)

Thanks and Remain blessed
Yours sister in the Lord

"Hello,

I hope this meets you well, I am Barrister Allen Beneth - Attorney to the late Engr. Earl Cox, an oil expatriate deployed to West Africa in 2014, he was working at an Onshore Oilfield said to be operated by Niger Delta Petroleum Resources not until April 27th, 2019 - My client (Engr. Earl Cox) was kidnapped by militants in Abua community in Rivers State, Southern Nigeria.

Unfortunately, efforts by the Joint Task Force (JTF) to free the kidnapped expatriates have been unsuccessful because the perpetrators could not be arrested, Since then I have made several inquiries to several embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client,I can easily convince the bank with my legal practice that you are the only surviving relation of my client, otherwise the properties and businesses he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by his financial institution. Particularly, the Bank where the Kidnapped/deceased had an account valued at about $13.8 million U.S dollars(Thirteen million, Eight Hundred Thousand U.S dollars).

Consequently, The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives since last year. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, so that the proceeds of this account valued at about $13.8 million U.S dollars can be paid to your account after the necessary paper works, then we can share the
proceeds after tax.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seal this deal.

Kindly provide the required details below;

"Assalammu'alaikum, Waramotuhu llahi Wabarakathuhu Praise Allah, The Most beneficient, The most merciful May Allah Swt always gives rahmat and barakah to the lord,lord families and countries,Amiin. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Hammadi a merchant in Dubai,in the U.A.E.I worked with Kuwait oil Company and eight years as a contractor,I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when Allah gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that the lord has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Syria.

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Indonesia and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Five million dollars $5,000,000,00 that I have with a security Company abroad. Insha Allah I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

By Allah I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosoms of the Lord.(Eidina Siratal Lmustakheem). Allah must be served in truth and fearness( Yah ayuah Ledhina Aamanu, Irjihi Illa Robika, Rodihatan, Mordihatan)..I shall give you more details once you reply this letter.
I have set aside 10% for you and additional 5% for your time.The lord be with you.
May Allah accept our prayers.

"as most of you know , nrg ' s proposed purchase of two coal plants in conneticut ( ui ' s territory ) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at ferc . the purchase and sale transaction between wisvest and nrg was originally entered into almost two years ago . the proposed purchase price of $ 350 million for 1000 mw of coal was a "" bargain price "" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of ct .
over the past 2 - 3 years , the state of conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "" puked "" the plants to nrg for $ 350 / kw in early 2000 . at a minimum , it is expected that $ 100 - 150 / kw of scr and / or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the ct regulatory bodies .
my strong view is that , as a practical matter , the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in ct . the area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire eastern interconnect . the load pocket is significantly short mw and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area . in a true "" locational marginal price "" environment , the prices would likely be similar to zone j in new york currently , pricing in nepool is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads , regardless of who causes the congestion .
in the recently proposed "" single ne rto "" model , it is about 80 % certain that the pjm "" locational marginal price "" market model will be implemented sometime between mid - 2003 and mid - 2004 . at that point in time , consumers in the congested areas of nepool ( in - city boston and ct ) will be exposed to higher energy prices , while consumers in maine , new hampshire , and rhode island should see lower prices .
given the facts above , coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets , i think ews should pursue discussions with wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in nepool and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "" node "" .

subject : thoughts post turbine meeting
is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee . i know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $ 10 mm to cancel the contracts ? if we could do we want to do this ?
how much money would we lose ( how much of a write down would we take ) if i told you i wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of september ?
as an aside , the mitsubishis will be leaving the enron americas balance sheet now and moving to egas . this does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward . for the company overall , we need to move these turbines ( as with all the others ) as soon as possible and we ( in the americas ) are in a much better position than egas is to move them . i have spoken to jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

dear vince ,
back in july , when you visited our sydney office you mentioned extreme value
theory . i am wondering whether research is looking into the application
of extreme value theory to power and esp . to weather . in a recent news
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t _ max , t _ min ,
etc .
i am in particular referring to the news article below :
in the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for
t _ max , t _ min , or below or above precipitation structures . the choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data . however , we are in
particular interested in the extreme events , and the application of evt could
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis .
has the research group looked into the application of evt to weather ? evt has
a long history of application in hydrology ( which would cover parts
of the precipitation structures . . . ) . also , research ( esp . at eth in zuerich )
is indicating the application of evt to v @ r . . . .
thank you !

"lenny ,
i believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit
issue . however , it may
make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed
in the future .
i am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit , which is built into
the strike price for the
digital option . with the tax credit , it is most likely the option will be
exercised .
paulo issler is the person who worked on this model initially . he will be
back this wednesday .
we can talk to him about the standard deviation he put into the model .

zimin ,
thanks for your e - mail . sorry for the late reply , i was travelling last week .
i ' m under the impression that the with the new administration , there is a
greater chance that section 29 will be extended beyond 2007 than repealed . if
this happens , we contractually have the right to extend this contract . we
have not valued the chance of this happening , so i don ' t think we should
value the chance of this not happening .
anyways , let me speak to my supervisor on this and revert .
in the meantime , i looked over the amendment you made with regard to adding
the second strike of the tax credit and think this is now reflective of the
deal and am happy with it . i still do not understand a few things re : where
did the st . deviations come from . i believe you said that someone who works
for you put this together but was away last week .
please revert with his / her name so that i can get together and understand
this .

lenny ,
i think we had a good discussion about the deal valuation .
one thing , i think you are prefectly aware of it , is that the economics
of this deal is driven by the tax credit ( $ 25 . 03 ) . the risk on our side
is that if the tax credit is removed , aig will not deliver the synfuel
and pay $ 4 . 55 to us .

"please treat as confidential
a source had a meeting today with california state treasurer phil angelides . here are the main points from their conversation
1 . anglelides certain that socal will go bankrupt
corroborating our line over the past four months , anglelides stated with confidence that socal would go bankrupt and that "" he was surprised they hadn ' t already . "" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . ""
he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . ""
2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough
angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office .
3 . new generator construction
anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

There is an account opened in this bank in 2003 and since my inception into office on 2nd Jan 2009, I then found this account and when I investigated deeply by contacting the assigned Next of Kin I also found that the Next of Kin to the account was an American who lived in London for over 63Yrs and nobody has operated on this account since after 2004. I took the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable to handle the materializing for this important transaction, in order to transfer out $100,000,000 (One Hundred Million U.S Dollars) After going through some old files, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing and the London Scottish Bank Plc management might divert the funds to her accounts. Please respond immediately and I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approval and onward transfer of this fund into your account with appropriate clearance from foreign payment department. You will stand to get 40% while 60% will be for me. Kindly quote the reference (Acc) numbers above when responding to this mail. I will furnish you in with more details upon your reply.

"hi - i just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday .
three people spoke at the meeting - jeff mcmahon , louise and philippe . there
was a lot of attention given to enrononline and it ' s success . greg whalley
spoke via satellite from london . the basic theme was what it is going to
take to survive in today ' s fast moving markets and how we are going to get
there , and that in five years all businesses will be internet companies or
not companies at all . . . . .
greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand
existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do
this but us because of our financial capabilities , reputation , and it
resources .
louise went over statistics , products offered , etc . on enrononline .
philippe discussed all the it projects in the works - the key one for ena was
enhancement of deal capture , valuation and settlements ( no surprises
there ! ) . one other common theme was streamlining our current systems . he
also confirmed the fact that we were moving from lotus notes to exchange , and
discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our
equipment ( and the ability to keep the room cool ) so they were looking to
ardmore for this .
jeff m . stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on
inefficiencies in the market , and get into other industries ( e . g . mg metals
in europe ) . he also stated that enron was going to venture capitalists for
financial support and backing . of course , this means that enron will have to
give up some control , but it leads to increased deal flow , market share and
new ideas . . . . he said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of
$ 1 b - most likely in q 3 .
i tried to capture the main topics , let me know if you have any questions !

Unity Bank Plc,
Nigeria,
 
Attention: Director/Ceo.

YOUR PARTNERSHIP REQUIRED URGENTLY
I am Dr. Lamis Shehu Dikko, the coporate Bank Manager of Unity Bank Plc.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you .On June 6,2001,a Foreigner Mr. Alex Smart Rodgers and the Managing Director of ASR Engineering and oil consultant/contract, with its head office/ Operational base at plot 123 Trans Amadi Industrial Layout Port Harcourt, Rivers State here in Nigeria.has the total sum of US$15,450:00 (Fifteen Million Four Hundred and Fifty U.S Dollars) deposited in the Company Account he operated with this Bank, with Account name ASR Engineering.

After 4 Years of the said Account lying dormant, we sent an official letter to the Company contact address and we did not get any response, after six months, we sent a notification letter to the Company, it was discovered that the Director and sole signatory to the Account, who died of a Cardiac arrest on the 23rd of August 2002, on further investigation it was discovered that Mr. Alex Smart Rodger in fact was an immigrant from Australia and only obtained American citizenship from the American lottery visa program, hence was unbale to declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork on making this discovery my Bank has expected the relative of the next of Kin of the late Alex Smart Rodgers to come up and lay claim of this deposited fund.

This money total US$15,450:00 (Fifteen Million Four Hundred and Fifty U.S Dollars) is still sitting in my bank as dormant Account. No one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to Nigeria law after 7 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if the account owner is certified dead, on making this discovery, I have resolved to protect this fund as to enable me procure the death certificate as issued by the Hospital as proof Mr. Alex Smart Rodgers death, I have suceeded in getting this document and a Copy of the Certificate of Deposit that was issued by my Bank to the late Alex Smart Rodgers.

I have contacted you in confidence as to enable me guide you on the steps required to stand as the distant relative of the Account owner and depositor (Mr. Alex Smart Rodgers) a bank account abroad will the facilitate the transfer of this money of the said sum in your favour as the rightful beneficiary, pending my arrival there in your Country for sharing and utilisation between us (you and me) as partners.

With my experience as a banker, I have perfected all arrangement on this as to ensure a smooth and hitch free actualisation of the whole arrangement, so long as the required confidentiality is maintained on your side as my partner and country the fund will be finally be transferred.
I have resolved that on the final transfer of this fund in your favour there in your Country, the sharing should be thus:
55% of the sum is for me, which I have to invest there in your country with your assistance as my partner.
40% should be for you as my partner, considering the fact that without you the arrangement will not be actualised.
5% is for pay back of every experience that we may incur in the process, immediately the total money gets into your Account.

This business transaction is guaranteed, so to embark on the process, I will require from you the following details:-
a) Your Personal Name and Company Name in full.
b) Your contact Address in full.
c) Your Mobile Telephone Number.
d) Your Telephone/Fax number.
e) Your Age.

Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

I AM, MR.JERRY MANKIND THE CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY TO THE NEW CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR, PROF. CHARLES CHUKWUMA SOLUDO. I WAS MOVED TO WRITE YOU CONSIDERING MY FAMILY BACKGROUND. AS A DEDICATED CHRISTIAN, I REMEMBER WHAT THE BIBLE SAID â€œTHAT WHATEVER WE DO HERE ON EARTH, GOD WILL BRING US TO JUDGEMENT, WHETHER GOOD OR BAD. SO MUCH INJUSTICE HAD BEEN DONE TO YOU.

YOUR CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY DELAYED AND DENIED FROM YOU BECAUSE OF A COMPLEXITY IN YOUR FILE. THIS THEY DO NOT WANT TO TELL YOU, INSTEAD THEY INTRODUCED A FALSE MODE OF PAYMENT WHICH IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA AS REGARDS FOREIGN PAYMENT THEREBY EXTORTING MONEY FROM YOU, AT THE END YOUR FUND IS NOT REMITTED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT, BUT THEY WILL COME UP TO YOU AGAIN WITH FICTITIOUS STORIES AND EXCUSES FOR THE DELAY OF YOUR PAYMENT IN THE NAME THEY ARE ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA FOREIGN PAYMENT GUIDELINES.

ALL THESE IS FALSE, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER NOW IS THAT YOUR FUND IS FLOATING IN THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA â€™S SUSPENSE ACCOUNT UNCLAIMED. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DIVERT IT TO AN ACCOUNT IN ASIA ( JORDAN ) WHERE IT CANNOT BE TRACED. AS I AM WRITING YOU NOW, ARRANGEMENT IS ON TOP GEAR BETWEEN THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR, THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION AND THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO HAVE ONE MR. SMITH HSU WHOM THEY INVITED FOR THIS PURPOSE FROM JORDAN TO CLAIM AS YOUR REPRESENTATIVE HAVING A POWER OF ATTORNEY TO ENDORSE ALL THE NECESSARY RELEASE PAPERS AND THEY WILL WIRE YOUR FUNDS TO HIS ACCOUNT.

THE MAIN PROBLEM AND THE ONLY REASON WHY THEY HAVE BEEN DELAYING YOUR FUNDS AND NOW WANT TO DIVERT IT:

(1). THERE IS NO NORMALIZATION OF YOUR CONTRACT ORIGIN. THIS CONTRACT WAS SUBLATED TO YOU BY â€œPRESTON COURT LTD OF CANADA â€￾ (BASED ON INFORMATIONS AND PROOFS OF THIS EVIDENCE GATHERED FROM THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS - ARCHIVES UNIT).

(2). PROPER CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP WAS NOT DONE COMPLETELY IN THE CENTRAL BANK AND THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE. YOUR NAME APPEARS AS THE BENEFICIARY, WHILEIN THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS - ARCHIVES UNIT, PRESTON COURT LTD APPEARS AS BENEFICIARY.

THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN BE ABLE TO STOP THEM AND SAVE YOU FROM THIS MESS IS THE CURRENT DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL REMITTANCE/FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA IN THE PERSON OF MR. BRUCE KENNEDY HE HAS BEEN MANDATED BY THE RPESIDENT, ALHAJI UMARU YAR'ADUA TO HANDLE ALL FOREIGN CONTRACTORS PAYMENT.

TELL HIM YOUR CONTRACT PAYMENT OF $18.5m HAVE NOT BEEN PAID NOR RECEIVED BY YOU IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

(1). YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF ANY PERSON IN THE NAME OF MR. SMITH HSU WHO CLAIMS TO BE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

(2). YOU DID NOT GIVE ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY TO ANYBODY OR GROUP OF PERSONS TO ACT ON YOUR BEHALF AND HAVE NOT CHANGED YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER.

(3). HIS PRIVATE E-mail: [brucekennedy01@gmail.com]

(4). THIS MATTER NEEDS A 100% ATTENTION OR ELSE YOUR FUNDS WITHIN THE

NEXT SEVEN BANKING DAYS WILL BE DIVERTED TO AN UNKNOWN ACCOUNT.

THEREFORE, YOU HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY IN COMMUNICATION WITH MR. BRUCE KENNEDY FOR YOUR OWN INTEREST GIVING HIM YOUâ€™RE UTMOST CO-OPERATION.

PLEASE TRY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TO KEEP ME POSTED. BEST

	3- The rest of the passengers
	4- The cabin and crew, who get a calcium substitute more
	   readily controlled by a quorum of preservatory agencies.
	5 (optional:) - Premium services and DRM for checked laptops.
They reactivate calcium channels and put the calcium back when
you arrive.  If you don't like it, you have to claim it as they put the
calcium back, subject to retries, and you have to remember the flight
number you actually arrived on to do that....and you suddenly know all about vendors!http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,0,"[""\u0120says"", ""\u0120which"", ""\u0120also"", ""\u0120from"", ""\u0120news"", ""\u0120pie"", ""\u0120something"", ""\u0120Seems"", ""\u0120slice"", ""\u0120rather""]","[0.16698285382256017, 0.16698285282109282, 0.14155546829033483, 0.14155546667132057, 0.11607959928539913, 0.08916284014776465, 0.06606002600165084, 0.05362477424637291, 0.05251806760702493, 0.046824868561749035]","[""Seems"", ""conference"", ""says"", ""concepts"", ""the"", ""theory"", ""you"", ""giant"", ""device"", ""pie""]","[0.029513021821106593, 0.025218431400221654, 0.02001784762547558, 0.019626905270942123, 0.019220882498687804, 0.01860879786586972, 0.014046329077750474, 0.008327592515729615, 0.008075161177365479, 0.00593251086406891]"

My name is Mrs. Kim Abbott of Marietta, Georgia. I am 72yrs old with no kid, I work as a Registered Nurse for 32yrs in several Orphanage Home all my lives before I lost my talking ability from a long time with cancer of the lungs and lymph nodes which also affected my brain from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that, according to my doctors they have advised me that I may not live for the next few months. This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very critical stage.

I am an orphan from child and was not lucky enough to be adopted into any home, so I spent my time in motherless babies home until I got married to my late husband for twenty years without a child. My husband who is one of the executives member of Oil rig company. Lost his life in Jurong Shipyard Jack-Up Accident that took his life and lot of people on board. My husband is super rich with one son before our marriage but it unfortunate that Richard lost his life with his nuclear family in a terrible car accident that took their lives 5 years ago. He would have be in better position to do this because I trust him so much and he has a kind heart like his father. I really miss them all.

Before his death we were true Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of of GBP22.8 million British pound sterling with a Security Company .

Presently, this money is still with them and the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of authorization for someone to do this on my behalf since I can not come over because of my illness or they get it confiscated according to the terms and condition. I am with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization,the poor and the motherless babies home where I was raised. I want a God fearing individual that will bring smile to the face of poor, churches, orphanage homes and the widows.

This is not impromptu decision made by me because of the illness. It is my long time wish to spend the money this way but it is unfortunate for me that I can't do this all by myself. This is the reason why I need someone to do this for me. If you are interested in doing this,

Please get back to me so that I can forward your contact to the security company and issue you a letter of authorization that will prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund.

I had recently entrusted a close person around me to renovate some churches and orphanage homes with the sum of $750,000.00 transferred into her account but she end up doing nothing and nowhere to be found, this is the reason why I chose to follow my heart and pray to God to lead me to someone from the outside. It doesn't matter you have to be a Christian or any other religions, all I need is someone of good faith and trust in thy lord and that can assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to read from you soon.

Yours In Christ,
Mrs. Kim Abbott.",1,1,"[""\u0120an"", ""\u0120enough"", ""\u0120lucky"", ""\u0120My"", ""\u0120husband"", ""\u0120people"", ""\u0120board"", ""\u0120adopted"", ""\u0120got"", ""\u0120Ship""]","[0.00045281355288182576, 0.00030884912722115596, 0.00030884772957324693, 8.496142054964943e-05, 8.495851319984484e-05, 8.458055635246061e-05, 6.413282352995671e-05, 3.3650402085183865e-05, 2.818943891548806e-05, 2.4860260637105674e-05]","[""Nurse"", ""old"", ""for"", ""Registered"", ""sum"", ""kid"", ""Orphanage"", ""doing"", ""Mrs"", ""I""]","[6.739644786916766e-07, 6.549057036498678e-07, 6.023586055988036e-07, 5.725599585419555e-07, 5.234107023347717e-07, 5.195796887991889e-07, 3.161112140151328e-07, 2.376135195027245e-07, 1.9268631445738975e-07, 5.471555601777149e-08]"

A new Amazon email scam is after your cryptocurrency

A crafty new piece of Macro-based malware has been uncovered that will target your Bitcoin stash

Bitcoin enthusiasts beware- email security firm AppRiver has issued warnings about a malicious email circulating posing as an Amazon purchase confirmation. Once opened, it injects malware that pilfers for just about every type of cryptocurrency in existence. 

'Over the past week we have been monitoring (and blocking) a stream of malicious emails attempting to pose as legitimate Amazon purchase confirmations,' confirmed Troy Gill, AppRiver's manager of security research. 'The messages simply state that ‘your order has been confirmed’ and contains a small amount of details. The user being targeted is directed to an attached .doc file for the shipping and tracking details.'

In order for the .doc to actually infect the user’s machine they must have Macro’s enabled for MS Word as the malware contained in the messages is identified as part of the Fareit malware family- a malware often distributed via Word documents with malicious macros embedded that has been known to drop multiple malware variants on the target machine. 

In this particular case the malware quickly goes to work attempting to steal the Outlook password along with website passwords from various browsers such as Firefox, IE, Chrome and Opera.

It then attempts to harvest account credentials for a lengthy list of FTP and multiple file storage programs. It then begins pilfering the target machine for your Bitcoin and other crypto cash, including Electrum, Miltibit, FTB Disk, Litecoin, Terracoin, and numerous others.

'This behaviour (stealing Crypto currency) is something we have been seeing with more frequency as of late,' said Gill. 'The anonymous nature and lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market make it more akin to stealing actual cash than to committing wire fraud by raiding someone’s online bank accounts. But in this case the cybercriminals are okay with that too- the last observed behaviour was to drop a copy of the Zeus Trojan to be used to capture and steal bank related information.'

Thankfully, most users are immune if they have Macros disabled by default, but Gill goes on to warn that those who have it already emabled or choose to follow the prompt and enable them will get infected. 

However this latest warning is likely to cause yet more anxiety over the security of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as attackers are clearly getting more imaginative as to how they target the virtual pockets of cryptocurrency users.",1,1,"[""\u0120enthusiasts"", ""\u0120beware"", ""\u0120Once"", ""\u0120just"", ""\u0120scam"", ""\u0120monitoring"", ""ers"", ""\u0120stash"", ""\u0120new"", ""y""]","[0.000101670406301461, 0.00010166973979384811, 9.464384229094894e-05, 8.912085467692377e-05, 8.691886010078284e-05, 8.295722963178859e-05, 7.753753015514376e-05, 7.552650738110362e-05, 6.859478039237168e-05, 6.859406571843116e-05]","[""A"", ""Bitcoin"", ""week"", ""such"", ""messages"", ""past"", ""most"", ""details"", ""but"", ""behaviour""]","[7.38878647662773e-05, 6.19627653717253e-05, 1.54051013422566e-05, 7.733110555039431e-06, 5.1129600284696275e-06, 3.37568581794169e-06, 1.9574204946876456e-06, 1.7614253243854385e-06, 4.746098743429702e-07, 3.4450605023990093e-07]"

Good Day, My name is Mrs. Zhang Xing, I am 73 yrs old and I am dying. I am from Hong Kong; Today I have decided to donate what I have to the poor. I am diagnosed with esophageal cancer for about 2 years ago and now I have few months to live, according to medical experts. I want you to help me donate from what I have inherited from my late father to the poor and needy.
 
I want this to be the good work I did on earth before I die. I have decided to WILL/donate the sum of Nine million, five hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($9,500,000.00) which I have with a bank abroad to you to help the poor and needy. At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my relatives are around me, they have squandered the funds I gave them for this same purpose before and because of my health status also.
 
I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware of it. I wish you all the best and may you be blessed abundantly for this purpose. Please use the funds judiciously and always extend the good work to others. 20% of the funds you shall keep for yourself for a work well done and for your effort and time. I want you to contact my lawyer Barrister Adam Gibson with the email email [adams201958@globomail.com] and he will instruct you on what step to take.
 
I hope you find peace and joy in your endeavors.
 
Thanks and God bless.

Dear Beloved One in Christ
 
I am Mrs. Marcy Markson from Abidjan the economical capital of Ivory Coast . I am married to Late Mr. John Markson of blessed memory who was a well known as cocoa dealer in Abidjan for through out his life before he died in the year 2010 after Ivory Coast November 28 presidential election crisis. We were married for 11 years without a child.
 
Before his sudden death we where born again Christian. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $3.600,000.00usd it with bank here in Ivory Coast. Presently this money is still with bank herein my country and i am very sick from cancer and tumor fibroid with stroke that i may not last till the next two months according to my doctor, so i want to donate to a Christian organization or individual who will use it to work for GOD and i have choose you after going through your profile.
 
You will retrieve this fund from the bank here by my direction, Also you will take me along to your country after the fund was transfer to you at least for a while treatment before the day comes close.
 
I want this money to be heard amount the next privileged since i do not have a child to inherit it and my late husband relatives are all non believers and i don't want my husbands heard earn money to be used in an ungodly ways (Gal 6 vs. 9 & 10 So lets no get tired of doing what is good at just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up, therefore when ever we have the opportunity we should do good to every one especially to those in the family of faith).
 
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with GOD the most holy and the most merciful. It is a very important confidential massage that i can fully detail you what i choose you for and as well give you a little knowledge on how to chive it
 
Any delay in your respond will give me room to seek for another born again Christian or church organization Until i hear from you my dreams lay subsequently on your shoulders.

Good morning

I am Ms. KESSY Danielle expert accountant and head of the accounting department of a Bank in Ivory Coast.

I have a proposal urgent and very confidential business to make to you. In June 2008, a petroleum Consultant Brazilian has opened an account with a value of USD 8,342,500 (eight million three hundred and forty two thousand five American Dollars).

We have been notified the depositary of the fund to our bank died of cancer since 2008. After investigation I discovered that he had died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.

After study of all the parameters in this case, I contacted that i could dispose of these funds without problem and the transfer to a foreign country in any legality. But for this i will need the help of a partner living outside of my country.

For that, I am prepared to give you 40% of these funds and the rest will be for me.

After your response, I will give you more details and documents to help you understand this transaction.

Waiting for your reply I wish you a good day.

Cordially,

Attn:  DIRECTOR,

It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter, which I believe will be a suprise, as we are both complete strangers. I am Benjamin Maxwell 19yrs old from Republic of Zimbabwe.

I am  contacting you to seek for your humble assistance, based on the money left in the bank by my late father ""Dr.John Glen Smith"" whom death accured on the 27th May 2008.

Before he died , he secretly called me on his sick bed and told me of this money # USD $9.M (Nine million United state dollars) which he left in the bank here in ABIDJAN- Cote D'Ivoire for onward investment overseas.

It might interest you to know that this transaction is highly confidential for both of us, and all the transfer formalities has been arranged. We have decided to give you 10% of the total sum if you are able to assist us on the areas of investment in your country, as we have practical reasons for not investing in Abidjan.

This money has secretly been deposited in a FIXED DEPOSIT BANK ACCOUNT where it can easily be transfer to a recommended bank account.

We look forward to har from you soonest.
Thanks and God Bless.

"Dearly Beloved in Christ Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am Mrs. Helen Rabbi Kamor, I am a nationality of South Africa, but I am presently hospitalized in Cape Town South Africa, due to my illness. My husband was once the Managing Director of Shell Oil Company in Iraq, where I and my husband spent most of our lives I am a widow to Late Mr. Mark Bello Kamor. I have served the Lord all through my life, from long time cancer of the breast to a very critical stroke. From all indications, my condition isserious and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe state and my doctor has told me this The one that disturbs me most is the stroke that paralyzed half of my body My late husband was killed during his reign as the Managing Director of Shell Oil Company in Iraq, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed along with his father through food poison in Shell Oil Company convention of 2004 in Baghdad. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all His business and wealth. Presently my doctor told me that I may not live for more than six months, though I am not scared about this, I am not afraid of death, hence I will be in the bosom of the Lord forever, any time my God calls me home . So, I now decided to look for an organization or an individual who is God fearing, that will use the funds for charity organization, by contributing to the developmentof evangelism in the world, assisting motherless babes homes and poor churches all over the world. I selected you after browsing the Internet for this purpose and prayed over it, for the fact that I always go to God in prayers in situation like this, because He is the Alfa and Omega. I am willing to donate all the money I have in the bank, the sum of Dollars$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Us Dollars ) to you for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you. Please note that this fund is lying with Bank in Spain, where I and my husband deposited the funds along with our family lawyer. My family Lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, you will have a reasonable percentage of the total funds when the funds gets to your custody, beforeinvesting the remainder of the funds for God`s works. I am not afraid of death because I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord.Exodus 14:14 says that the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. God told Abraham, ""I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, so in thee shall all nations of the earth be blessed. Lastly, I want you and your church to keep praying for me regarding my health, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life, is vanity upon vanity. If you have to die says the Lord, keep fit and I will give you the crown of life Please include your direct telephone number where I can reach you easily, so that I can call you and have a word with you.May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you now and Forever more, Amen.

I would like to invest heavily in your country on a business you really have experience in so you can help me in the management of the company.

Actually I have 2 million USD which i got from my late fathers security vault.During the current crises against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters of President Robert Mugabe,of which they claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his Followers,he ordered all white farmers to surrender all farms to his party members and his followers.My my late father is one of the most successful multi- farmers in our Country and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas Mugabe's supporters invaded his farm and burnt everything in the farm,killing him and made away with a lot of items in my late father's farm.I am right now making an arrangment on how to take this fund(cash cos can not be transferred without trace) out of Africa to a country where at least I have somebody who can help me in this business.I am having a serious contact with a bank here in Dakar Senegal that will assist to legalize the money and get it transferred to any bank in any country of my choice without any local or international problem.Please let me know your willingness to transact with me as soon as possible by giving me the following informations bellow.

"Hello Friend,
I am contacting you with a heavy heart because of the latest ugly developments in my country Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) There has been increased fighting and massive killing of people because of Presidential election dispute between the incumbent Presidents. Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.My name is Ms.Precious Sarah Nguessan. My father was a former senior official in the government but the political opponents have killed my father last December when the initial crises and violence broke out. I have managed to run away for my dear life and now taking refuge in Bamako-Mali. I also succeeded in taking one of the trunk boxes where my father stashed money (USD 4.5M) Four Million Five Hundred United States Dollars along with me which I have deposited with a private security company here in Bamako Mali.Please, I will like you to assist me in transferring the fund to your country so that it could be used for investment purposes. I shall reward you handsomely if you assist me with my request.I shall be expecting your response as quickly as possible.

My regards

"
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Patrick Thompson a merchant in Dubai,in the U.A.E. I worked with Kuwait oil Company for eight years as a contractor. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer which has defiled all forms of medical treatment,according to medical experts I have only about a few months to live.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on mybusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have Willed some of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.Yet I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia.

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused and kept the money to themselves.Hence I have lose my trust on them,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

At the advise of my lawyer who happens to be a very busy man as he is occupied with other official tasks,thus he would not have the time to assist me with this mission as I want to see this done before my death.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad.I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time .God be with you.

The Lord is my Strength
Remain blessed

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"and goals for 2000
houston - enron corp . hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in
houston . ken lay , enron chairman and chief executive officer , opened the
conference by highlighting enron  , s tremendous growth across all businesses
and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade .
enron presented key objectives for 2000 :
? continued strong growth in the core wholesale energy businesses .
? break - out performance from retail energy services .
? rapid development of enron broadband services .
enron  , s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a
recurring theme throughout the day .
wholesale energy business
growth prospects remain strong for wholesale energy operations and services ,
enron  , s largest business . wholesale energy growth in north america is
expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the
united states and large - scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large
energy consumers . enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across
the european continent as markets quickly open to competition . finally ,
enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as
japan , where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity
provider in march 2000 .
enrononline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are
generated through this innovative , internet - based transaction system . over
450 customers around the world have used enrononline and over 10 , 000
transactions have been completed since its introduction in late november
1999 . yesterday , enrononline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions , representing a notional value of $ 250 million .
transaction processing costs with enrononline are significantly lower than
costs associated with traditional transaction methods .
enron  , s gas pipeline group is also well positioned to continue growing , with
expansions planned or underway on several of its systems .
retail energy services
with over 16 , 500 facilities under management , the infrastructure is in place
to service customers worldwide . as the strong contracting momentum
continues , enron energy services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in
2000 . enron energy services  , goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts
representing $ 16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and
energy services , nearly double the level in 1999 .
enron broadband services
the new name of enron  , s communications business , enron broadband services ,
reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband
services . enron is deploying an open , flexible global broadband network
controlled by software intelligence , which precludes the need to invest in a
traditional point - to - point fiber network . this enron intelligent network is
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to
internet service providers , thus providing the platform for two new enron
business centers , bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery .
a direct transfer of enron  , s core market making and risk management skills
from its energy businesses , bandwidth intermediation will provide
capacity - holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible , low cost
capacity . enron will also provide premium broadband content services , such
as high - quality video - streaming and large broadband file transfer , with
differentiated levels of quality in a usage - based business model .
as announced in a separate release , enron also reached an agreement with sun
microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband internet
services .
enron is one of the world  , s leading electricity , natural gas and
communications companies . the company , which owns approximately $ 34 billion
in energy and communications assets , produces electricity and natural gas ,
develops , constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide , delivers
physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers
around the world , and is developing an intelligent network platform to
facilitate online business . enron  , s internet address is www . enron . com , and
the stock is traded under the ticker symbol ,  & ene .  8

section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 e of the securities

achieved . important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include
political developments in foreign countries , the ability to penetrate new
wholesale and retail natural gas , electricity and broadband services markets ,

hello all ,
i ' m planning the agenda for this year ' s management conference . i ' ve been working on the upcoming meeting since march , but as you can imagine , the direction has changed several times .
we are delighted to have general norman schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership , and gary hamel returning to help us process the past year . while we have arranged an all - star line up of outside speakers , we also want to focus on what is happening inside enron . rather than having only one or two business presentations , mark frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate .
currently , the panel is scheduled to take place 8 : 00 - 9 : 30 am on friday , november 16 . please plan to present a very high level overview of your business . you are welcome to use powerpoint slides , but in the interest of time , presentations must be no more than 10 minutes . mark will introduce each of you , interject questions , encourage interaction , and ensure we stay on time .
below is the proposed order for your presentations . regardless of your place in the rundown , you will need to be seated on stage by 7 : 50 am and equipped with a microphone . because we have a full agenda that morning , we will try to begin the session promptly at 8 : 00 am .
stan horton - global services
louise kitchen - americas
john sherriff - europe
mike mcconnell - global markets
jeff mcmahon - industrial markets
janet dietrich - retail
if you elect to use a powerpoint presentation , please forward it to me electronically by friday , november 9 or provide the presentation to me on cd at the management conference . to ensure consistancy , i ' ve attached a powerpoint template that i would like you to use .
>
finally , mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4 : 00 pm on wednesday , november 14 following your arrival at the management conference . the meeting will take place in the library off the main lobby of the westin la cantera . in the meantime , if you have any questions or need any assistance , please contact me . i look forward to working with you .

?Attn:

I am aware that this letter has come to you as a surprise as we have not met nor handled any business deal in the past. Nevertheless, I have contacted you with genuine intentions and I hope I can trust you with this Inheritance opportunity which I will explain below.

My name is Mr. Louis Auclair, an account manager with National Bank of Canada in Montreal Quebec. I got your contact address in my search for the next of kin to a deceased customer of our bank ?Mr. Albert?, a citizen of your country, who lived and died in London from Cardiac Arrest in the year 2010.? Unfortunately this customer died interstate leaving his bank account in an open beneficiary status. All efforts made by our bank to locate his relatives have been unsuccessful so I decided to write you as I have monitored this account in the bank for almost 10 years now and no one has come forth with any claim. I would like to present you to our bank as his next of kin to claim this dormant account worth $17,500,000.00 USD (Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) Only.

?You will apply to the bank as an extended relative to the deceased customer while I work from the inside to make sure all needed information and evidences are provided to you to back up your claim. The account has an open beneficiary status, which is why I have contacted you to come forth and claim the funds as the next of kin and ?beneficiary. Since he is from your country and you both share the same last name, it will be easy for you to become his official next of kin. If we do not make claim to the funds now, the funds would be reverted back to the system as unclaimed estate at the expiration of a 10 year dormancy period.

?I assure you that this transaction would be handled under due inheritance procedures and every necessary legitimate arrangement will be put in place to make you the real beneficiary of the inheritance funds. It also requires all confidentiality at this stage and I believe that you are ready to keep this absolutely confidential until you are able to claim the funds from the bank. Once the funds are released to you, it will be shared between the two of us.

Please send your response ?indicating your readiness to proceed with this transaction. Upon your response I shall give you more details and we will have an in-depth discussion regarding a successful completion of this transaction.

I await your response

Sincerely

" 
As his legal adviser for over twenty five years, the said Mr. Ashraf Abbas Choudhry instructed me to write his WILL immediately after the death of his wife because they had no child, he dedicated his wealth to God. According to the WILL, all his properties should be sold after his death and the money should be given out to any honest Christian or the chosen Christian Ministry that deserves this fund by His Grace purposely for the work of God in order to propagate the work of God. As his legal adviser, all the documents for the properties were in my care because he gave me the authority to sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries of God in order to expand His Kingdom.
 
In short I have sold all the properties after his death, as initially instructed by Mr. Ashraf Abbas Choudhry in his WILL before his death. And as a matter of fact, after I sold all his properties, I realized more than Five Million American Dollars ($US5, 000,000+) and what supposed to be my legal fee percentage is 10% of the total sum based on the initial agreement between me and the owner of the properties before his death. But by the way of my ungodly attitude then I joined all the money together with my ten percentage (10%) fee instead of giving out the main fund for the work of God as initially instructed to me by the owner before his death, I converted the entire fund to myself with the intention of investing the entire fund in abroad for my personal use rather than giving out the money for the work of God as instructed by the owner before his death. Although I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, not only because I have to give account to the bank on how I got such huge amount due to the strict
 
Therefore, as I was preparing myself to fly to Holland due to my persistent illness then, in order to have access to more money from the security vault that contained the fund, so that I can remove out of the money again to take myself to the best Hospital in the United States of America in order to receive the best treatment in spite knowing fully well the negative impact / eyebrow that will be raised on the money based on my decision then to open the Vaults that contained the money in the presence of the Security Company, I then had encounter with Christ when Evangelist Richard Madison was preaching on television concerning cheating, betraying and many bad attitude of human beings on earth especially when he recited out Leviticus 6:2-7 that Says If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the LORD by deceiving his neighbor about something entrusted to him or left in his care or stolen, or if he cheats him or if he finds lost property and lies about it, or if he swears falsely, or if he commits any such sin that pe
 
After hearing the word of God from this man of God, I then gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian as I have also heard through the preaching of the aforesaid Evangelist Richard Madison that every sick men or women can be healed only by God especially whe he also recited out Ezekiel 33:18-19 where the word of God says: ""When the righteous truth from his righteousness, and Committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby"". From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could be well and have peace in my life is to first of all accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour, and also to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry that deserves this fund for the work of God as instructed by the owner before his death. Hence I started attending healing crusade of Pastor Paul Reid of Christian Fellowship Church over here in my Country, there I confessed all my si
 
Consequently after my healing, I then asked God for forgiveness and I know that God have forgiven me, but I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before his death. Even in spite I did not have any money with me again presently, yet I have made up my mind not to be tempted in taking more than my ten percent (10%) from the said money again, rather I have to give out the money to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before his death because the Glory of God (THE SALVATION) that I have presently with me now is more than what any amount of money can buy. And having known my condition I have decided to release this fund to any church or better still to any Christian individual that will utilize this money in the way of God. I want a church or individual that will use this fund to propagate the word of God in order to expand His Kingdom.
 
So after my fasting and prayers, as I don't want a situation whereby this money will be used in an ungodly manner, I asked God to make His choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the chosen ministry that deserves this fund by His Grace. I then came across your outfit on the Internet as I was browsing some Christian sites and some other sites on the net, although it is not only you or your outfit that I initially picked on the Christian site, but after my fervent prayer over the picked names, then you were nominated to me through divine revelation from God, so this is how I received such a divine revelation from the Lord and how I got your contact information, I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely by you or through you for the things that will glorify the name of God. Although the said ten percentages (10%) of my legal fee will still be removed from the money if possible during the movement of the money to you or after the arrival of the money in your care since the said ten perc
 
However, you should be informed that I am now a born again Christian and in most honest manner of speaking, I am now a simply servant of Lord trying as much as is in me by the direction of Holy Sprit, to do the will of God in my own life. I understood that the wealth of sinners are acquired for the just, God opened my eyes to the book of Ecclesiastes 6:1&2, read this scripture very well and you will understand that there are people in this world that God gave the grace to acquire wealth yet God did not give them the grace to enjoy the wealth, and the late Mr. and Mrs. Ashraf Abbas Choudhry happened to fall into the same category, now it is the wish of God when God used me through them to give out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of His work as instructed by the owner before their death. I understood that God was testing me like he tested Abraham and other men of God. Abraham needed children and God asked him to use his only son for sacrifice, Abraham was faithful, he obeyed and God made him fa
 
More importantly, due to the fact that I will not want to disobey the Commandment of God, and also upon the instruction given to me by the owner before his death in accordance with the scripture of MATTHEW 6:1-4, that says we should do our alms secretly and our Father that see it secretly will reward us openly, as to obey God's commandment is our best wisdom of life, hence the need for me to require from you the assurance that you will keep this transaction absolutely private and confidential within yourself alone.
 
NOTE: In view of the huge amount involved in this transaction and the period of time that the consignment has stayed with the security company in Holland of which it will definitely require financial assistance to be used in bringing the transaction into completion while I also don't want to put the burden of financial spending on any chosen Christian Individual or Ministry that deserve this fund by His Grace. Hence I have secured a reliable financier who will provide all the financial assistance / funds that will be required from time to time to have this transaction complete. Therefore, you will not be required to pay any fee at any time till this transaction is finally completed and the funds are secured in your care.
 
So if you know that this fund will be honestly and wisely used by you or through you for the things that will glorify God's name as really want by the owner before his death, then do urgently contact me back through this my private email address only (barrpetejcole4christ@mailpersonal.com), and the details shall be given to you on how the money will be received by you in your country.
 
Finally, you should also forward to me your telephone number especially your cell phone number for the easy and speedy communication concerning this mission fund.
 
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.
 
Yours faithfully in Christ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

Dear one,

It's my pleasure to contact you for a business venture which I and my Son Williams,intends to establish with you in your country.

Though I have not met with you before but I believe,one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life.

There is this sum amount of money ""Twenty Six million U.S dollars""($26,000,000.00) which my late Husband MR. JOHNSON YALEY deposited for it's safely for an investment Abroad,before he was assasinated by unknown persons.

Now I and my son Williams decided to move out the fund to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough in Abroad for security, political and economical reasons. We want you to help us to transfer this fund to your account in your country for investment purposes on the followings below:

1). HOSPITALS.
2). REAL ESTATE.
3). FIVE STAR HOTEL.

If you can be of an assistance to us, we will be pleased to offer to you 20% Of the total fund.

Thanks and hoping for your reply.

Yours Faithfully,

"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .

"i had a brief discussion with marcus buergler on tuesday regarding the portland space . i indicated to him that our desire would be to move , but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made . in the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money . on top of that , there are roughly $ 600 k worth of improvements ( separating from pge ) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce .
based on my very brief discussion with marcus on tuesday , i was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building . i learned today that the estate has accepted the pge lease for this space and that we have to stay here . this is very depressing if it is true .
from a money point of view i don ' t think that it is the best decsion . more importantly , from a morale point of view this place is horrible . we have 15 , 000 square feet when we need between 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 . it is absolutely depressing here . people are very much in favor of moving .

RE: YOUR 16.3MILLION USD WITH CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA       

This is to inform you that investigations and intellegience conducted by Interpol states that you have an unclaimed US$16.3million with Standard Chartered Bank in Nigeria. This was deposited on your behalf by the National Lottery with regards to the Lottery you won last year.     You were asked to contact Bola Adesola of Standard Chartered Bank in Nigeria to open and activate an account for you at the cost of $100 but that did not work. As a result of this, the funds have been moved directly to the Central Bank of Nigeria. They will transfer the funds to you but you are to pay an Administrative and Processing fee of  US$80(Eighty United States Dollars Only) before they can transfer the funds to you.   

  You are to contact the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele. He will direct you on how to pay the $80.

"Dear ,

It is quite regard and respect I grave your indulgence, knowing that  this proposal will be a surprise to you. I am Donatus Choo, an  attorney at law and the accredited legal representative to late Mr.  Jackie , who was here in after, as my client. He died as a  result of a heart related disease in the Month of December 2005.

I have contacted you to assist in the distribution of the funds left behind by my late client, before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank officials, and this deposit valued; Three million six hundred thousand united states dollars.

This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or have the account confiscated.

My proposition to you is to seek your consent in presenting you as the next of kin beneficiary to my late client's Estates, so the proceeds of this account can be remitted into your account as a foreign partner.Then we can both share the funding on a mutually agreed percentage.

All legal documentations to back up your claims as my late client's  next of kin will be provided. Then, all I require is your absolute honesty, cooperation and total adherence to my instructions, to enable us transfer this funds into your account smoothly. And I do not need any money from you in order to achieve this transaction.

This transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement, which will protect you from any infraction of the law.

I Am Dr Christopher James, an Accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C.). I Headed A Seven-Man Tenders Board In Charge Of Contract Awards And Payment Approvals. I Came To Know Of You In My Search For A Reliable And Reputable Person To Handle A Very confidential Transaction Which  Involves The Transfer of a Huge Sum Of Money To A Foreign Account. There Were Series Of Contracts Executed By A Consortium Of Mufti-Nationals In The Oil Industry In Favour Of N.N.P.C. The Original Value Of This Contracts Were Deliberately Over-Invoiced To The Sum Of USD$17,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million US dollars) this Amount Has Been Approved And Is Now Ready To Be Transferred, Being That The Companies That Actually Executed These Contracts Have Been Fully Paid And The Projects Officially Commissioned. Consequently, My Colleagues And I Are Willing To Transfer The Total Amount To Your Account For Subsequent Disbursement, Since We, Civil Servants Are Prohibited By The Code Of Conduct Bureau. In Return, We Have Agreed to Offer You 25% of the Transferred Sum, While 10% Shall Be Set Aside For Incidental Expenses (Internal And External) Between Parties In The Course Of The Transaction. You Will Be Mandated To Remit The Balance To Other Accounts In Due Course. Modalities Have Been Worked Out At The Highest Level Of The Ministry Of Finance And The Federal Reserve Bank (F.R.B) For The Immediate Transfer Of The Funds Within 14 Working Days Subject To Your Satisfaction Of The Above Stated Terms. Our Assurance Is That Your Role Is Risk Free. To Accord This Transaction the Legality It Deserves And For Mutual Security Of The Funds The Whole Approval Procedures Will Be Officially And Legally Processed With Your Name Or The Name Of Any Company You May Nominate As The Benefice Beneficiary. Once More, I Want You To Understand That Having Put In Over Ten Years In The Civil Service of My Country, I Am Averse To Having My Image And Career Dented. This Matter Should Therefore Be Treated With The Utmost Secrecy And I hope to hear from you urgently

CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT AWARDING

P.M.B.5028
ACCRA-REPUBLIC OF GHANA
Email: [kwakofila010@yahoo.co.uk]
 
 ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD18.850 MILLION
 
Your Attention:
 
I am Dr. Kofi Kwame, The Chairman, Contract Awarding Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS) with its fund Headquarters in Accra-Ghana. I got your information in a Professional database when I was searching through Internet for a reliable, honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with. I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names in the list of the directory. After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues, they were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual business relationship. We wish to transfer the sum of USD18, 850,000.00 (Eighteen million eight hundred and fifty thousand   united States Dollars only) into your personal or company's bank account. This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by us intentionally for the supply of hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/ medical items, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other administrative/logistics for the ECOMOG in Sierra-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping Projects.
  
This deal was deliberately hatched out and carefully   protected with the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organization. We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from different countries during the crisis. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa. This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and porous political nature of this sub-region. The original contractors have been duly paid by Ecowas banker through the Central bank of Ghana and finance ministry. The balance is suspended in the ECOWAS grand account awaiting claims by any foreign partner of our choice to receive the fund on our behalf Now Ecowas is intending to pay all their outstanding balance of their contractors this year as the organization is winding up its activities since the aim of returning peace to the countries and the coast has been achieved. Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working under this organization, are not allowed to operate/own a foreign account. This is more reason why we needed your urgent assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country. It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation, 65% will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.
 
This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide the followings for immediate kick of this deal if it interest you; YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS, TEL AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available) THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS. THE ACCOUNT NUMBERS THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.  Upon the receipt of this information, application for claim will be sent to you to fill and return back to the organization in pursuit of the claim legally and then be forwarded to the organization for ratification and subsequent payment. As with the case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead honorable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved. Kindly expedite action if you  are interested as we are behind schedule to enable us utilize this golden opportunity pay out this fund immediately which we might stand to loose, if we fail to provide a safe account for this transfer on time at the expiration of this year Ecowas has mapped out for payment of all their outstanding contractors and the dissolution of our committee.
 
Please urgency is needed as we do not know the time our organization will start the payment hence it is necessary to start on time to forestall any hitch while transferring the fund into your designated account. Get back to me on this email address: [kwakofila010@yahoo.co.uk]
Hope to hear from you.

I did everything within my reach to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice than to try it. I messaged the spell caster, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before three days. He cast the spell and surprisingly on the second day, my husband called me. I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that had happened He wanted me to return to him. He also said he loved me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. The spell casters email is : odomoddumu@hotmail.com.

"vince and ravi ,
attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the university of
chicago with an ms in mathematics . his specialty is financial mathematics
and his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that i
understand your group to do , vince . he is extremely interested in enron and
contacted me because i am an alum of the college at the u of c . i gather he
didn ' t go through enron ' s typical recruiting process for analysts or
associates because his background is more technical , than commercial . he
acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you
can tell that he is young . he would therefore be willing to start as an
analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non - rotating position , but
his interest is in doing the kind of work that you do , vince , and ravi , i
know you have a similar background .
please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you .
if so , feel free to contact him directly . he would like to start work this

I have a business proposal in the tune of US$15M (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS), This account has remained dormant for quite a number of years, owing to its dormancy, I, with my position, discovered that it belonged to one of our deceased customer, l want to front you in the bank so that you can apply for the claim of the fund as the next of kin to that late customer who died years ago with his entire family while on holidays. As a result of his death, several attempt, was made to locate his family without success, so then the bank after several meetings had been held to that effect, a conclusion has been drawn to get the fund transferred into the bankâ€™s treasury as an unclaimed fund, to my own conception, it did not go down well with me that is the reason for my search for a foreign partner to apply and assist me for immediate transfer of this money. Therefore, lam assuring you that after the successful transfer; we shall share in ratio of 40% for you and 60% for me.

You should understand that as an insider in the bank I will do every thing possible to protect your interest and to make sure that I follow things up as soon as you are willing to work this out with me because I will not want this money to go into the bankâ€™s treasury. Should you be interested, please contact me so we can commence on all arrangements to that effect and I will give you more information on how we shall handle this project when after you must have declared your willingness and capability to this proposal. Please treat this business with utmost confidentiality and send me the Following information, through my Email address

Dear Sir/Madam.

   My name is TAO SHANYUAN, and my home address is PONDOK JATI CR-1, SIDOARJO-61251, EAST JAVA, INDONESIA. I am writing to you to help me on both  humanitarian and mutually benefiting interest grounds. I am relying on your  help; in return, I will compensate you most generously. My story is not  unique or new, but I believe this approach will bring a solution to my family  ordeal. You are the 5th person that I am contacting and I hope you will be  the last! Please forgive me for invading your privacy; I obtained your address  information from Internet Search. I specifically chose free, open societies,  which we can only dream of. Because I believe you are a busy person, please  let me briefly outline my agenda, and then, I will proceed to give you details. I am an orthodox Christian and a minority ethnic Chinese of Indonesia, and  though we as a people have suffered Official and private persecution for  years, our suffering and marginalization have recently assumed alarming  proportions. We as a people have suffered religious persecution for years,  but recently the economic downturn of Indonesia has been blamed on us and we  have become the scapegoats...Please check the following website http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/aug1998/aceh-a28.shtml

  In the light of the foregoing, I took precautionary steps years ago and established a numbered Account in UK -

STANDARD e-Global Bank
London Borough of Barnet,
The Town Hall,
The Burroughs, Hendon NW4 4BG
London UK.
Fax: +44 7006 087 251
Phone: +44 7031 889 031, +44 7031 889 010
Funds on current deposit - US$25,375,406.98

   As it turns out, it was my wisest and best decision yet, and the future of my  family is now centered on this money. How? Since the Riots broke out, the ethnic Chinese, particularly the rich and middle class have been restricted  from emigrating to other Countries with their wealth. The Secret Police trail  and watch your every move; even as I write to you, my telephone is bugged and  I and my family are virtually on house arrest. A Visa application by the  unwary is an invitation for trouble and the Secret police will instantly be  at your door and your bank Account frozen...These are the sordid details that  our dear President Megawati Sukarnoputri does not want the world to know  about! On a practical side, I have tried both openly and also clandestinely  to obtain visas for myself and my family at the American Embassy, Address: Jl. Merdeka Selatan 4-5, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia Phone (62-21) 3435-9000;  Fax: (62-21) 385-7189, and my efforts proved fruitless; even an application  on humanitarian grounds to the American Ambassador, Ralph L. ""Skip"" Boyce,  was turned down for ""want of merit"", an official language meaning that a grant of visa will be against the interests of the State of Indonesia!

   In summary therefore, I am planning to emigrate to America or Canada or any  other Western Country, and I need your help. I cannot do it from Indonesia.  As a wealthy man, I have some means and help, but because of the prying eyes  of the Secret Police, I am greatly handicapped. I have made a lot of research  on the internet and I have a plan that will work, with your cooperation...I  will require your help to retain an immigration Attorney who will prepare the  basic paperwork for me; I will thereafter arrange with a ""contact"" in the  Secret Police to ""procure"" visas for myself and my family from Malaysia. This  contact will, at the appropriate time arrange passage for me and my family to  meet with you in your country after you have claimed my funds into your bank  account.

  Once in your country, I will be free to access my money ( impossible  at the moment because the nature of my Secret numbered account dictates that  my foreign partner/next of kin can claim my funds on my behalf upon my  instructions to my bank in UK...(It was set up specifically this way to avoid  any one or the Secret police forcing me under coercion to wire the funds back  to Indonesia or anywhere; it is my greatest security). If you are willing to help me, You will please do 2 things for me ;

(1) Filing in an application for claim with the STANDARD e-Global Bank, UK  for proper transfer of my funds to you upon my instructions.
(2) You will retain an Immigration Lawyer to advise me (though, from my researches, my emigration to America/Canada is assured because of my SUBSTANTIAL UK HOLDINGS); ...I am not afraid of betrayal because presently I  and my family are staying at a ""SAFEHOUSE"" secret location under an assumed  name, and the secret Police can not trace me from the above address of  course...
(3) You will please arrange air charter transportation for me and my family  from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to your country)...details will  follow later. If you are willing to help me, please reply ONLY by email, and  we will establish our game plan.

  Please bear in mind that you have not, and you will not be committing a crime  both under International Law and even Indonesian Law...You are simply rendering humanitarian help...for a small financial consideration. Mr. Wong  Cheng, my Secret Police contact person, who is processing our visas from Malaysia explained to me that he will arrange Tourist Visiting visas for me  and my family . The visas will according to him will be good for about 1  month Entry into USA/Canada, or any other ""Western"" Country is therefore NOT  the problem per se. My problem is that I and my family wish to stay  PERMANENTLY in either USA or Canada or any other Western Country. You have to  appreciate the hard fact that I and my family are fugitives even in my own  country; I therefore desire to quickly and expeditiously legitimise our permanent Stay abroad. I do not wish to take chances because of the risk of REPATRIATION BACK TO INDONESIA! This is why it is vital that an Attorney be  retained to immediately take up our case and prepare for our arrival. As I said earlier, there is no need to bother about our visas; these will be  taken care of by Mr. Wong CHeng. The Attorney's job is to process the  paperwork to guarantee our permanent stay in USA/Canada or any other Western  Country. As soon as our visas are obtained by Mr. Wong CHeng, I will arrange  to send all Passport copies/visas to you so that you can give them to the  Attorney. Once we arrive, he can then start his work. Unfortunately, I can  not pay any charges upfront because I have no access to my funds in UK. I  therefore appeal to you to put the Attorney on notice that he will be paid his charges/fees as soon as we arrive your country to access my fund. This I  think is reasonable since the actual work of the Attorney will commence IMMEDIATELY UPON OUR ARRIVAL YOUR END. I know this will be a great inconvenience because Attorneys everywhere always demand UPFRONT RETAINERSHIP  FEES AND CHARGES!

  I know that your assistance per the above is very valuable . I wish therefore  to make absolutely sure that nothing goes wrong. Secondly, I really do need your assistance to set up a corporation plus a corporateBank Account .  Please note that I will NOT be sending you funds for preliminary expenses for  the reasons which I mentioned above.

Thank you so much, and May God bless you!

TAO

PS: The Account in UK was set up under ""SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES"", as you are now aware; I did not want to take the chance of being forced to wire back my funds to Indonesia! It happened to some of my compatriots who were careless,  and the Government Agents forced them to send back their money under force/blackmail.

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL

Dear,

This is a personal letter directed to you and I request that it should be treated secretly/confidentially.  I am MR. Michael Reason Esq., the personal attorney/sole executor to the late Eng. < relative's name >, who worked with the national diamond company of Angola for thirteen years before he died along with his family in a ghastly motor accident along Luanda road in Angola, which occurred on the 26th of December 2004. Since the death of my client, I have written several letters to the embassy with an intent to locate any of his extended relatives whom shall be claimants/ beneficiaries of his abandoned personal estate and all such efforts have been to no avail. More so, I have received official letters in the last few weeks suggesting a likely proceeding for the confiscation of his abandoned personal assets in line with existing laws by the Financial institution in which my client deposited the sum of USD$15.5M, The board of directors of the Financial Institution now adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money as an abandoned fund.  I found out that some members of the company want to divert this fund into their private accounts for their own selfish interests and only want to use the excuse that since I am not able to look for some one to make the claim, the money should be made unserviceable and that means submitting the find to the government of this country.

By virtue of my closeness to the deceased and his immediate family, I am very much aware of my clientâ€™s financial standings.  I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client which is legally possible and would be done in accordance with the laws of the land.  On this note I was urged to contact you, that I may, with your consent, present you to the â€œtrusteeâ€￾ Financial Institution as my late clientâ€™s surviving family member so as to enable you to out up a claim to the institution in that capacity as a next of kin of my late client, so that the proceeds of this deposit valued at Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (USD$15.5million) can be paid to you.  Note that this is legal and 100% risk free since I find it possible for the main reason that you bear a similar last name with my client making it a lot easier for you to put up a claim in that capacity.  Therefore, to facilitate the immediate re-profiling of this fund, you need, first to contact me via my email address and telephone number signifying your interest and as soon as I obtain your confidence, I will immediately intimate you with the complete details as well as fax you the documents.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  Please get in touch with me through my email;
michaelreason223@gmail.com for better confidentiality and send me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss the this transaction.  Like I said,  I require only a solemn confidentiality on this.  Please let me have your opinion as soon as possible on my above email address or call me on Tel- +44 790 9419 164 and if this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed on you, I await your urgent response.  Get back to me at your earliest convenience.

Yours Sincerely

Thanks for the letter xxxxx

I guess i have to detail everything to you, so that you better understand..

The Job position opened for you is Supervisor / Personal assitant. Haven gone through your resume, and knowing you have great experience i fabrication and related works, we thus, choose ths above mentioned position.

As the supervisor, you will guide a team of weilders and repair men in installing new devices and repairing existing devices where neceaasr . for example we have about 1,000 customers calls in a monthto install, repair or upgrade their internt lines, and this is part of your job to ensure that the people under your control do the needed within adequate time.

You don't necessary need to go with them, all you need to do is provide them with what to do, when to do it and how to do it. Your job does not necessary require an interview, so that is not a problem. You will be interviewed after your training upon arrival to malaysia, becuase this is a real life duty compared to paper works, and you are supossed to know what we are interviewing you on.

If after the interview, you don't meet the reqirement, Digi telecommunication will pay you 15,000 USD (fiften thousand US Dollars) in compensation, but i am quite sure you will meet the interview because you will be trained, all you need to do is to watch and answer is an ABC approach.

As for the job offer letter, our procedure is this way,
- send me your air ticket
- i will send you the offer letter and contract in 2 days
- you accept the offer and sign the contract, then scan to me
- we will immidiately start the processing of your working permit
- the working permit should probably last for 2 weeks
- after that you will get your working pass, and we will arrange date and time once you have your working pass, this is to avoid any inconveniencies.

Plz note that you have to open an account with any malaysian bank through our department and you have to do it once you have the offer letter.

What i want you to understand is that my Boss is actually Benneth's uncle, and she was the person who applied your job in person. I think the job is yours as long as you act fast, there is nothing to worry about that, i guess she must have told you as well.

So now to summarize everything, let us start from the first approach, and that is, you have to send me prove of your airticket and the rest will be just a matter of time. I advice you to use Wahtung travel agency,through Benneth becuase it is more convenient to us. She can send me the airticket instantly after booking it, compared to you who have to scan and send, and you can have the refund as well if you miss the flight.

Other things you might know is that our branch has 2 other supervisors from Turkey and India, both male. You have your own personal office, and free Lunch every working day. Digi telecommunication is the larget telecommunication service provider in Malaysia, and the largets employer of foriegn labour in Malaysia.

server. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. 
Nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their 
mail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, 
not when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, 
it means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some 
people may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because 
they don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be 
sleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean 
that at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. 
Knowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are 
constantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over 
10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people 
already recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database 
before you would get your 1000 votes.Also, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for 
only one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 
sleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value 
99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.
In RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the 
thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.Also, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree 
on whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 
reports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) 
mail.You mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. 
First, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the 
legitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the 
more people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see 
the mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read 
time, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, 
re-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.So I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.	Jehan-------------------------------------------------------

Hello,
 
Im sending you a special greethings which i hope it will meet you in goodhealth. I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will. I am Abiba,21years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr. and Mrs Faki Yao My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2008.
 
Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2008 on our to the hospital and he disclosed to me secretly that he has the sum of Sixteen million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.

(USD$16.700,000) left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks in Abidjan Cote d ivoire Africa . I am just 21 years old and really don't know what to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually has brought sorrow to my life.
 
I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter? 2. Can I completely trust you? 3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your account? Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

Hello Co-investors,

I want to introduce my self as General Andrew Azazi Nigerian Military officer, presently in Ghana for consignment clearance mission. I am calling on interested business men and women who will be willing to invest on this crucial business to help the poor and the needy.

During last year we diverted a lot of consignment to our neighboring countries which has been claimed by investors. Presently I have 7 consignment deposited under my control by Mohamed Yusuf the leader of Boko Haram, (Islamic sect) in Bornu State of Northern Nigerian who was killed on 1st august,2009 by the Nigerian army at Bornu State Police Command for sponsoring terrorist .

This consignment was deposited in a security company in Ghana under my control as the army general operational director.

I can not directly claim these consignments because of my service with the Nigeria army but assist you in all necessary aid to claim the consignment as witness and deliver to you as the Next of kin to the late Mohamed Yusuf. This is to avoid government taking over the consignment without listening to the less privileges.

Your urgency to process the claim of these consignments will be welcome. I assure you that this deal is FREE from any RISK. Interested persons should provide their below information;

Your Full Name
Telephone
Country
Occupation
Your Next of Kin

NOTE: The affidavit of ownership will be on your name as the next of kin to Late Mohamed Yusuf. I will forward you details once I receive your mail and the percentage sharing of the consignment content.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a "" final or startup "" list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob

"My Dear Friend

I am very happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred abroad with the help of a new partner from one of the leading European countries. I withheld the name of the country for security reasons.

Currently, I am in Europe for investment projects with my own share of the total amount that I am investing in real estate business. Meanwhile, I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it was not successful with all your efforts.

Now contact my Reverend Father in Accra, Ghana, through his contacts, as described below, and ask him to send you the bank of draft with an amount of FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS (USD$450,000.00) Dollars which I kept as your compensation for all your past efforts and attempts to assist me in the fund transfer.

REV. PASTOR ROLAND ELVIS.
St. Peters Church of England.
Accra, Ghana.
EMAIL: pastor_rolande@yahoo.com

I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So do not hesitate to contact the Reverend Father and instruct him where to send the bank draft to you.

Please let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the your efforts at that time. At this point, I am very busy here in Europe for the investment projects which I and my new partner is having at hand.

Finally, remember that I have instructed the Reverend Father on your behalf so, do not hesitate to contact Rev. Roland Elvis, he will send you the bank dreft without any delay.

I wish you a happy time of life.

SALAMALEKUM,

 Greetings in the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful,

My name is Mr.  Abdullah Mohammed, a widower to Late Mrs. Aishat Mohammed am 65years old; presently I am suffering from longtime cancer of the lunges, from all Indications, my condition is really deteriorating and am very much afraid of my doctor?s report, infact my Condition is very bad now, My late wife was killed during the Gulf war, and During the period of our marriage we couldn't produce Any child.

 The doctor has told me that I may not live beyond this year. Every new day is like a bonus to me. So now I have decided to divide part of this wealth, to contribute to the propagation of Islam and in assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful and all humanity in Africa and throughout the Muslim world, I choose you after visiting the website and I prayed over it, I discussed this with my Attorney, Barrister Jackson Collins. I am willing to donate part of the sum ofUS$18,000,000.00(Eighteen Million US Dollars) for the development of the holy work as well as a distribution to aid Muslim faithfuls and also for the less privileged, including orphans who lost their mothers through this deadly illness [cancer] no matter their faith. Please I want you to note that, this fund is deposited In a Security Company For that, my lawyer Barrister Jackson Collins will file in application for the transfer of the money in your name as you wish provided you are ready to use part of this money for this purpose.

You will therefore have to travel, to sign for the official Release of this money as well as advice on how you want the money remitted to you own account. My Attorney will accompany you on this trip. Lastly I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be used for the said purpose because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Allah is vanity upon vanity. For this reason I have decided to set-aside 40%of this money for the service of humanity and the work of Allah.

May the Grace of Allah be our guide and be my refuge when I leave this World. More so, I decided to offer you 30% While 20%will be transferred to the account of my Lawyer,

Barrister Jackson Collins as compensation after Successful Conclusion The remaining 10% is to cover the expenses both from your side and the side of my Lawyer who will assist you until every thing is over. A Swift acknowledgement of the receipt of this email would be appreciated. you are hereby direct to response to my private mailing address <m.abdullah58@yahoo.no>

I am waiting your mail.

Mr Abdullah Mohammed",1,1,"[""\u0120throughout"", ""\u0120has"", ""\u0120told"", ""\u010a\u010a"", ""\u0120all"", ""\u0120Africa"", ""\u0120marriage"", ""\u0120couldn"", ""\u0120we"", ""\u0120war""]","[1.5631490766213956e-05, 1.2662170029636568e-05, 1.266087074072755e-05, 8.211465140267247e-06, 8.159156665981614e-06, 8.156695782350124e-06, 4.111860777024461e-06, 4.111860777024461e-06, 4.111190346858301e-06, 3.3402600239555374e-06]","[""from"", ""trip"", ""email"", ""offer"", ""transfer"", ""own"", ""use"", ""be"", ""report"", ""Aishat""]","[3.5123906288244925e-06, 3.1599739754971397e-06, 3.1578058757584967e-06, 3.067617169793145e-06, 2.899649669306055e-06, 2.154926634325839e-06, 1.8437702115924545e-06, 1.2286834102417872e-06, 1.0097509320031683e-06, 9.635422131563873e-08]"

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

Dear

I am in receipt of your email and glad you have accepted to partner with me in this. We never know when life is about to shower us with good fortune, however we spend so much time wishing that life does.

I am Sgt Williams Adams serving at the U.S. military ( Bagram Airfield ) base in Afghanistan. I found your contact detail from a search for a partner, am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of $10,000,000.00 to you as long as I am assured that it will be safe in your care until I complete my service here in Afghanistan I really don't know what to say. I believe in building up a good relationship with you as a friend and as a business partner, which I never did have before. I want us to have a good trust for each other as this transaction will be successful only if we can work together and make things go well. I am a very straight forward man, am honest and sincere in all I do, because I believe in having a good name.

I understand the important responsibility you are taking for this deal to be successful as without you and your commitment, we cannot claim the funds, hence for your involvement, I am willing we share the money 40% to you, 60% to me but you can let me know if this is not okay with you. The most important thing is for everything to happen smoothly without any problem, and that all of us can enjoy our share of this money with absolute peace of mind.

I await your urgent response, so that we can proceed with the process.

Thank you and God bless.

Yours,
Williams Adams

Dear Sir,

My name is Mr. Michael S. Larthy the first son of late Colonel Gbovo M. Larthy.

My father was 2nd in command to President Jerry J. Rawlings of Ghana till J. J. Became a civilian president of Ghana.

All this year's of service my late Father acquired a large sum ofmoney ( 41m usd ) and about 3000 Kilo Grams of Gold bars .

Sir I propose to you if you can partner with me and my family to use the money and buy the Gold as you deal on Gold business and ( PPMC ) will export the Gold out of Ghana for trade, this the only way we can avoid Money Laundering .

Sir kindly go through my proposal and get back to me and I will give you more details.

"Dear Marie

Upon review of your questionnaire, we consider you a strong candidate for
the job position of personal shopper.

Working Process brief description:

1. You will get a full name of the item and where you can buy the goods. (It can be an online store or a usual shop in your county)

2. As soon as you`ve bought a correct item, you need to inform us about it. (Buying something from a store, you need to pick a fastest delivery method they offer) Please don`t forget to send us a copy of the order confirmation or invoice from a store where you have placed an order.

3. We will send a deposit on your credit card to pay for a purchase. (Total order value XXX + $80 for postal fees + 5% from the total order amount, which is your commission)

4. As soon as deposit will appear on your credit card, you are shipping the parcel to a correct recipient. (Normally your card will be funded within 2-3 days)

5. Just a few days before the shipping of the parcel, you will get an invoice from our company. The invoice from a store must be removed from a box and saved in your folder at home. Every 2 months we will request all invoices to be represented for us.

6. In USPS you need to fill in full receivers address and choose a correct shipping option. Please send everything as a gift ($200 - $250 value of the package) (It will save some money for us and our clients as well)

7. If the shipping has been completed successfully, you will get a tracking number. All tracking numbers you must provide to us asap.

Is it OK for you?",1,1,"[""Working"", ""\u0120personal"", ""\u0120fastest"", ""\u0120delivery"", ""\u0120Process"", ""\u0120brief"", ""\u0120which"", ""\u0120amount"", ""\u0120order"", ""\u0120sho""]","[3.895026816663517e-05, 2.832434325155987e-05, 2.5232361893406005e-05, 2.5231113004219998e-05, 2.0714291362362238e-05, 2.071404083308949e-05, 1.9703071609318977e-05, 1.3626191809952978e-05, 1.3624735061057436e-05, 1.3140580254860434e-05]","[""Dear"", ""your"", ""you"", ""shopper"", ""Upon"", ""You"", ""review"", ""Process"", ""don"", ""goods""]","[0.005811042061593554, 0.005241521355479328, 0.005235511582158313, 0.005058122610505338, 0.004801275506339828, 0.004345022142936813, 0.004196471502897352, 0.0035612845461519506, 0.003528522776515499, 0.003498865282340909]"
"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

Attention: Beneficiary,
 
I am Special Agent Erick Bolt from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs). We intercepted two consignment boxes at JFK Airport, New York. The boxes were scanned and they contained large sum of money ($4.1 million) and also some backup documents which bears your name as the Beneficiary/Receiver of the money.

"vince ,
a quick project update .
1 . sandeep and i spoke with robert schenck in adelaide . he will email a
henwood proposal to us . they already figured that we must be interested in
modelling dabhol .
2 . the wti eol trading simulation had an error . we were counting a
mid - offer spread profit on each trade , but we actually would make the spread
on each round - trip transaction ( one trade to open , one trade to close ) . i
modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to greg whalley ( he is the
one who caught the mistake , so there goes my bonus for the year . ) and john
lavorato . i should probably re - run the earning volatility numbers , and
update ted murphy as well .

"Okay . Coraggio is available I am giving him out to a good home for $500 he is  Pure-bred GERMAN SHEPHERD puppy. He is 10 weeks old now  ready for a new family, he  is potty trained, he  does his business outside only,
He is so animated and will keep you entertained for hours. He has his own distinct personality, and very playful, always want to go outside, love to be around kids, he like to give kisses, and have very affectionate personalities separately. He  does need to rest at various times of the day because he is still infant  he  is well socialized with kids and cats and he simply love lots of attention. He is up-to-date on all shots and worming and current on vaccination. Corragio will be going to his new home with his copy of USDA paper, 5-year Health guarantee, AKC registration paper and pedigree, vaccination and worming record. I'll also include tips and steps for training him an approved carrier with a soft comfortable bed, a puppy pack including sample food your pup has been eating, a tube of Nutri-cal. Everything you will need will be taped to the top of your puppy's carrier, I have a lot of people interested in adopting these puppies.

but before Adoption takes place and if you are still interested, I will like to ask you a few questions. I want to make sure my babies are going to the best loving home where it will be loved and cared for. Puppies should be human best friends and not there for status sake. Prove to me if I grant you the opportunity to adopt my baby that you will give him or her all the love and affection he or she deserves to get from you and your household I'm sorry if the questions are too much I just needed to be sure.

1. Do you have kids?
2. Have you ever owned a puppy before?
3. Why do you want this puppy and do you have what it takes to make my baby a family member?
4. Will you promise to give my baby all the care, love and attention the puppy deserves?
5. Will you promise to send me updated pictures of the puppy after two weeks of stay in your home?
6. Which of the puppies do you want?

NOTE: I reserve the right to refuse adoption of my puppies to anyone.
I reserve the right to call and check on my placed pups.
I reserve the right to request for pictures of my pups long after adoption.

I do welcome pictures and stories about how they are doing. I have many owners sending me pictures years after placement, I love knowing my dogs are happy and well. My puppies are of good quality. I socialize with the pups several times a day. My pups have known nothing but love from the humans in their lives and expect humans to be the givers of love and attention. I do my best to provide the best buyer education in caring for this breed. This is why I want to know they are safe and adjusting well in your home.

PLEASE NOTE: Only for serious families, I only need a family or someone with so much love and an open heart for pets to have my babies, who are very affectionate towards children and other pets.

Greetings,
This is a private and confidential  email am sending toyou  and I request that it be treated as such. I wish to solicit your Confidentiality and assistance , while  assure you that I am contacting you in good faith,this proposal would of  mutual benefit. to you.I am James Ruff, a Attorney at law. I am the personal Attorney to the late Mr. Allan Gonzalez  who was  my client had worked as an independent oil magnate in my country, and died in automobile crash along with his immediate family in East London on the 5Th of November 2006.
My late client long before his death had placed a deposit of Five Million Six Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling only? (5.9 million) with a Securities and investment company. After the death of my client, the  finance company contacted me, as his attorney to notify me of the maturity of the investment and that I  provide his Next of kin , who legally recognized as the right person or persons to inherit such fund.Since the death of my client, I have tried to locate any of his relative(s) through the embassy all such efforts have been to no avail.The board of directors of the company just reached a resolution that I MUST provide a next of kin for the payment of this money within the next 15 official working days or forfeit the money as an abandoned funds.
I have reasoned that the best thing to do, would be to legal present a next of kin of my deceased client. This is legally possible and would be done in accordance with the laws of the land. On this note I decided to search  for and present somebody who would stand in as his next of kin. I am seeking your consent, to adopt you as my late client's relative and with this in mind,would  put up a claim for the dormant fund.  I have all vital documents that would confer on you the legal rights to make this claim and would make them available to you soon as we reach a compromise to work on it together.
 
I do sincerely sympathize the death of my client but think it is unprofitable for his funds to be confiscated by government or some financial institution.I had worked relentlessly with my late client seeing him make much of the money, it would be unreasonable to see other benefit from the fund to my exclusion.Not been able to locate his relatives even makes matter worse.When the fund is released in your favour we both would give to share it in the following ratio,40% to you and 60% to me.Can I trust you on this? I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear(s).
That we successfully start and conclude the transaction requires confidentiality. Please get in touch with me by my alternative email (jamesruff2@umail.net).The following is my telephone: +44 702 407 4751.I will appreciate you send me yours.I hoping that  would not take  undue advantage of the trust I have reposed in disclosing the transaction and the details here.

My name is Scot Parker. I just came about your email address through an email listing affiliated with the US Chamber of Commerce and I would be very interested in offering you a part-time paying job in which you could earn allot without quitting your present Job or having problem with your employers.

I am a man with 4 kids all boys and the love of my life, my wife. I am a some what multi talented man and I do quite a lot of traveling and get to meet quite a lot of people.

I just resigned my job as a research scientist for ARINI (Agricultural research Institute of Northern Ireland ) but I still work as a freelance consultant for the Company which gives me very much time to do my own work which is basically being a freelance researcher who could be employed by research institutes to do research projects anywhere in the
world.

I reside in Ireland, Dublin even though I have lived most of my life in other parts of the world, I am fully residing in Ireland. Presently, I have just been granted a funding to head a research project in the tropical regions of West Africa regarding rare and vulnerable plant species and this would be commencing very soon.

However my funding were by my American counterparts who send me the bunch of payments mostly in US based money orders. Getting an accountant in the states or opening an account would have been my best choice but I have a deadline to meet and taking any of those choices would cost me time and a whole lot of other requirements. I am not ready to deal with, as I would be traveling a lot in the meantime.

So presently, assuming you would be able to deal with cash, I would be willing to employ you on contract basis to be my payment representative back in the states, this way I could issue and make payments in form of Money Orders, Cashier's Check, etc out to you, you could then cash them easily, withdraw 5% of the total amount on these payment instruments as your commission and then send the rest back to me through wire transfer.

Please, bear it in mind that we would be dealing with quite a handful of cash and you could be making up to $5000 just working with me in a short period of time within 1-2 weeks.

I would be glad if you accept my proposal and I intend to commence on starting as soon as you are ready. If you are interested, please email me back so we could make concluding arrangements.

Thank You

"john :
claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed
jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and
semis . he did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a
simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average .
the results show a good r - square between the general index and individual
jackup categories - on the range of 0 . 7 - 0 . 8 . only one category displayed a
poor r - square - about 0 . 3 . for semis of 4 tht and 5 th generation , however , we
noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - r - squares about 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 .
you may verify each regression by changing the choice cell ( ax 2 on analysis ) .
claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages ,
12 month swaps on gas / crude , and rigs utilization explains the daily rates .
we will forward the results as soon as we finish .

I'm Tekin Tufan, a staff at Vakif Bank , Turkey I am contacting you in regards to a deceased client who died in an auto accident on the Istanbul Highway in 2003, he was a prominent client of mine.

Before his death, my client deposited ($ 36,000,000.00) at the vault of my financial institution here in Turkey, documentations regarding these transaction indicates that claims can only be made by his Next of Kin. Unfortunately he had no will at the time of his death.

All efforts made revealed no link to any of his family member. However, the New EU law of succession/claims/fund indicates a duration in which such claims could be tolerated. The financial institution have mandated me to present the next of kin who will claim the funds and Failure to respond to this ultimatum would legally allow the financial institute to report this funds to the central bank of EU as unclaimed funds.

I and my colleague have put in place all necessary requirements concerning the release of this funds and It is my intention to introduce this opportunity to you as the beneficiary.  Please note that I'm legally equipped with all necessary information/documentations concerning this fund.

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

vince ,
he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background ( and then some credit exposure calculation ) with not much credit data analysis experience . i do not think he would be appropriate for bryan ' s group - - he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data , and although this guy may be good at modeling , we already have iris and amitava doing the modeling and looking at data . at this stage , i would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis ( banking , rating agency ) . i am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience , then amitava will find himself with two people ( iris being the other one ) who are both inexperienced in this area , and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway .
if you want to pursue him , we should probably do a phone interview first .

Dear Friend,
 
I write to you based on the request by an investor and his need for investment/funding in your company. My name is Martinez and a practicing lawyer in Europe.

My company most times represents the interests of very wealthy investors (HIGH NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS)  due to the sensitivity of the position they hold in their society and the unstable investment environment of their country, they evacuate majority of their funds into more stable economies and developed nations where they can get good yield for their funds. 

A reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with few years ago with a proposal, recently, approached me that he wants an individual/company that will assist him to invest the sum of ($200.000.000.00) Two Hundred Million United States Dollars in Bank Guaranty on his behalf in a good profitable business in your company/country for a period of  10 years for a start.

You are required to provide me with your complete information including your international passport copy  to enable me commence documentation between you and my Client for the Liquidation of the Bank Guaranty valued for $200million only.

Other details like the percentage due to you for your assistance / partnership will be agreed upon in our next email exchange.

We look forward to a cordial Business relationship with you and you can call me on +44-20 7060-9596  for more details. 

Best regards

"Dear friend,

My name is Godwin Sima. I need a partner that will help me shift my assets worth of $100,000,000.00 to your country. You may be expecting me to discuss terms with you before we will start the project, but because of the urgency nature of the need to shift the funds, I prefer I tell you my terms and expect you to either reject or accept.

My plan is that we open a fresh account and receive the money or through any other means and you will take 20% for yourself and keep 80% for me. I will not be open in the process of the transfer, but I will secretly sponsor and monitor the transaction until the end.

If we can go into this deal, send me the following information.
1.Your full names
2.Your residence address
3.Your 24 hours contact telephone number
4.Your secured e-mail address
5.Your occupation

I wait for urgent response.

Dear,

Greetings and peace be unto you.

I write to solicit your support because I know you can help me and hopefully you will. absolutely.

I am Andy Johnson from The Republic of Sudan. I know my country willnot need much introduction to you as the whole knows what is going onthere for the past fifteen years or more. My parents lived and broughtme up alongside my younger sister in Dafur region in our country wherethe war has been most intensified. I am a living testimony of the warin Dafur as I managed to survive assasination when my parents weremurdered during the war.

I am now back in Ghana where my father had investment before he died.My father was a DIAMOND MERCHANT as you I mentioned.

When the government started tramping on all Diamond Merchants, myfather told me he made a trip to Ghana where he deposited some moneywith a bank as safe keep for the family. He registered it as familytreasure. He informed me that the cash was kept inside a trunk box andthe amount is USD$14.3m. He told me where to get the documents to thedeposits as he made me the next of kin on the deposit which he made onbehalf of our family. I have all the documents with me now.

I want to relocate from Ghana so and to settle down and invest thistreasure wisely and further my education beyond my diplomat inManagement certificate. My status here can not afford me such luxury asI am a refugee and Dafure (Sudan) is not an option for me to return tonow. I need a foreign partner who will facilitate the money out of thiscountry as my father had such an agreement with the bank. I know I needsomeone with good and sound personal integrity and appeal to assist mefacilitate the retrieval of the money from the bank and receive it inhis country. You will also assist me in securing the right type of visainto your country where I will settle down and invest under your guideand supervision.

I will give you 25% of the total money if you assist me and I will gointo joint business with you while I supply the business capital. Yourservice will be of great advantage when we are getting required papersto settle down and do business while I also still go to school.

All I need from you is your readiness to assist me and your valuableadvise is welcome. Please consider my plight as well as my sister'sbecause all I do now is hawk on the street and beg before I can eveneat. The deposit is not accessible to me until I chose aguardian/partner who will be competent to help us manage theinheritance (according to my dad's agreement with the security company.I have a treasure in this country and I suffer like pauper. All I needis your consent and readiness to receive the deposit on my behalf.

Please let me have your reply immediately so that we can get thistransaction done once and for all and promptly. You may help me as aperson or as an organization if you have or work for a company who willwant to assist me.

I am counting on you.

Thanks in advance.

"Dear Friend

I am Mrs. Emelia Brown, I am 68 years old born in U.S.A, and I am suffering from a long time cancer in the Lungs which also had affected my entire well being, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating. According to my doctors they have advised me that I may not live for the next two months, this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad level.

I was brought up from an orphanage home, was married to my late husband for twenty years and we lived in London until my husband died in a fatal motor accident in London. Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the money with a bank in London. Presently, this money is still with the bank and I have not operated the account for a long time due to my illness.

Presently, I'm with a laptop in my hospital room, where I have been under going treatment for cancer in the lungs for over one year. Recently, doctors told me that I have only a few months to live so I quickly called a pastor to give me positive advice concerning my money. He ministered to me to share this inheritance with the orphans in orphanage homes and people that need money for survival.

It is my last wish to see that some percentage (%) will be distribute among the charity organizations, the poor and orphans in orphanage homes where I came from and some percentage (%) for devoted individual that will utilize this money the way I wish. I took this decision because my time will soon be over and I do not want the bank to inherit the money if I eventually die.

I want you to honestly accept my decision and send me the following details to enable me instruct my bank to process all my money valued Ј3.5 million GBP and transfer to you as my beneficiary. As soon as I receive your reply and the details, I will issue a letter of authority to my bank which will empowers you as the beneficiary of my money, in as much as you give me assurance that you will do my last wish.

"Hello my dear,

I could not contact you earlier before now due to my tight schedules. I am very happy to inform you about my success in getting that money under the cooperation of a new partner Mr Gastritis Melberg from Sweden Presently I'm in Sweden with the partner for some projects with the money.

Meanwhile,I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in that process despite that it failed us at that time. due to no trust.

Now, I want you to contact

Rev. pastor David Gabriel
St. Dominic catholic church
Medina Road
Dakar Senegal,
 [pastordavidgabriel@yahoo.com]
+221-763975407

This Rev.Helped me a lot when the going was too difficult and i decided to keep your money with him because he is a man to be trusted and a man of God to the chore.

Arrange with him how the total sum of five hundred thousand  Dollars ( $500,000.00 ) will reach you safely which I have already kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much.

So feel free to get in touch with The Rev pastor. and discussed with him how the amount will reach you.Please do let me know immediately you contact him to receive it so that we can share the joy after all the sufferness at that time. As at moment,I am very busy here because of the projects which I and the new partner are having at hand.

Finally,remember that I had forwarded instruction to To the Reverend on your behalf to receive that money,so feel free to get in touch with him and he will send the amount to you without any delay.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

Greetings, my name is Mr. Nahla Saoud, I work as operations manager with a reputable bank here in my country. 

In our current performance of annual audit, I discovered a late client funds in my bank worth $15.6M. I want to present you as the owner in my bank since I am the only one aware of the funds due to my investigations and there were no beneficiaries stated concerning these funds. We shall discuss other information to facilitate the remittance of the fund once I hear from you. 

I will appreciate if you could contact me through my email address: ( mrnahlasaoud1@e-mail.ua )

Dear Friend,
I crave your indulgence to kindly attend to this mail in good faith. I do not mean any disrespect by approaching you through this medium; it is due to the urgency of the matter. I am Mr. Dennis Lee Esq, a Chinese private financial consultant here in Shanghai, China. A personal financial consultant to Late Dr Eric T. Hansen, A businessman who died here with out a Will leaving no one as his next of kin to lay claim to his Estate and money deposited in one of the commercial banks here. I have made several enquiries to locate any of his relatives but this has proved unsuccessful.
 
After several unsuccessful attempts to locate any of his relative since over 2 years now, I decided to trace his relatives to locate any member of his family, Hence I am contacting you to assist in securing the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank, Before his death, he had a domiciliary account valued ($7.5M ) United State Dollars (USD) with a commercial bank here.   The bank has since issued a notice that I provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated within the next one month. 

All I require is your honest cooperation and trusts to enable us see this deal through within the next 14 business day .I am a signatory to the account so I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law as i already have all legal documents and prove regarding the said money. 40% of the total amount will be offered to you if you can complete this transaction with me. 

Please get in touch with me immediately through email to indicate your interests to enable us discuss more details and start the process with out any further delays. Kindly include your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.

Best regards
Dennis Lee

" Subject: Good News Your Compensation

Dear friend.

Due to my tight schedules I could not contact you earlier before now. I am very happy to inform you about my success in getting that money under the cooperation of a new partner from Asia. Presently I'm in China,with the new partner for some projects and some research in Poultary farms here with my share. Meanwhile,I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in that process despite the facts that it failed us at that time along the line,Now contact my lawyer in Cotonou,Benin Republic,his name is Barrister.Henry Jalingo on (henry_ass01@yahoo.es) and ask him to send you the total sum of (usd850.000.00) in International cashier's Cheque which i kept for your ""COMPENSATION"" for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in that matter then. I appreciated all your efforts at that time very much.So feel free and get in touch with him and discuss with him the best way for you to get it.

Please do let me know immediately you receive it. At the moment,I am very busy here because of the projects which my new partner and I are having at hand. Finally, remember that i have left instructions on your behalf, so feel free to reach him immediately.

Please extend my greetings to your family and once am less free and after my medical check up i will try to visit your family.

Yours faithfully.

My Dear
 
I am more than happy in your mail. How do you do today ? . My name is Grace (24 years) single and never married, I am from the sierra-leone in Africa and I am currently living in a refugee camp here in Dakar-Senegal as a result of war that took place in my country.
 
My late father Dr.Larry John was Managing Director (LARRY AND SONS INDUSTRIAL COMPANY  LTD) in capital of my country sierra-leone, before the rebels attacked our house one early morning and killed him and my mother in cold blood. It was only me that is alive now and I was able to make my way to a country Senegal, where I live now as a refugee.
 
I would like to know more about you, your like and dislike, your hobbies and what you are doing presently. I will tell you more about myself in my next mail.

Attached here is my picture, have a nice day. Hoping to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Grace.",1,1,"[""\u0120refugee"", ""\u0120was"", ""\u0120me"", ""\u0120that"", ""\u0120would"", ""I"", ""\u0120able"", ""\u0120know"", ""\u0120It"", ""\u0120IND""]","[2.4069683422567324e-05, 1.1735926501643964e-05, 8.178403905004839e-06, 8.175051651704005e-06, 7.834121083760692e-06, 7.53551721572876e-06, 6.669977947056882e-06, 6.43205518523852e-06, 5.000079862582378e-06, 4.867185363985836e-06]","[""Director"", ""currently"", ""sierra"", ""know"", ""tell"", ""Dakar"", ""morning"", ""possible"", ""I"", ""camp""]","[4.347572779039723e-06, 4.139693525870726e-06, 3.574442948857044e-06, 3.4576690789025697e-06, 3.4557805611578905e-06, 3.4218604198375944e-06, 3.158958068115768e-06, 2.875899339616128e-06, 2.647492824342027e-06, 2.44929067980018e-06]"

"Hello Dear

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

Due to my careful search for an honest, reliable and sincere business partner, it took me time to make up my mind to contact you and to offer you this proposal of mine of which my whole life depends on.

My name is Miss AMINA IDOWU, During the current crises against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to  surrender all farms to his followers.

My father is One of the most successful multy farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe`s ideas, Mugabes supporters invaded him, killing him and made away with a lot of items in his farm.

Before his death, my father had deposited with FINANCE HOUSE the sum of (USD $6.5 MILLION) SIX MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. After the death of my father, i re-located under political asylum as a refugee to seek  for foriegn patner overseas that will assist me to move this money out of THE FINANCIAL HOUSE to your country.

As an asylum seeker i am not allowed to operate any Bank Account within ACCRA GHANA.I have agreed to offer you 7% of the total sum for your assistance as soon as the money get`s into your account.

I want truth and honest to be our watch word in this transaction. All I want you to do is to furnish me with your personal phone and private e-mail address for easy and urgent communication.

Thanks and God bless,
AMINA IDOWU.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

However, I have been unsuccessful in locating their relatives, I seek your consent to present you as a relative of the deceased family for the claim of this funds from the bank. I will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that a successful claim is achieved, for your assistance; I have decided to give you thirty five percent (35%) of the total sum at end. And 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might occur during the claim of this fund

I will have to put the necessary legal documents that can be used to backup this claim. All I required from you is your honest cooperation to enable this deal go through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a Legitimate arrangement that will protect you and I from any breach of law. I will also need your most confidential telephone number/ mobile that I can reach you anytime. You can write only to my Confidential Email: [<email]brianconway@gmx.co.uk>[/email], Please try and get back to me, this transaction demands your most concealment and I don't want any third party involve. I know this is the right manner to conduct this mutual benefit but due to the time frame this fund has to be transferred before it will be confiscated.

"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.Anyone else with this problem?

your subscription to the frbnyrmagl list ( federal reserve bank of ny
research publications ) has been accepted .
please save this message for future reference , especially if this is the
first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list . if you ever
need to leave the list , you will find the necessary instructions below .
perhaps more importantly , saving a copy of this message ( and of all
future subscription notices from other mailing lists ) in a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed to . this may prove very useful the next time you go on
vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up
your mailbox while you are away ! you should also save the "" welcome
messages "" from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list .
to send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list ,
just send mail to frbnyrmagl @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . this is called
"" sending mail to the list , "" because you send mail to a single address and
listserv makes copies for all the people who have subscribed . this
address ( frbnyrmagl @ peach . ease . lsoft . com ) is also called the "" list
address . "" you must never try to send any command to that address , as it
would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed . all commands
must be sent to the "" listserv address , "" listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . it
is very important to understand the difference between the two , but
fortunately it is not complicated . the listserv address is like a fax
number that connects you to a machine , whereas the list address is like a
normal voice line connecting you to a person . if you make a mistake and
dial the fax number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone , you
will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again . no
harm will have been done . if on the other hand you accidentally make your
fax call someone ' s voice line , the person receiving the call will be
inconvenienced , especially if your fax then re - dials every 5 minutes . the
fact that most people will eventually connect the fax machine to the
voice line to allow the fax to go through and make the calls stop does
not mean that you should continue to send faxes to the voice number .
people would just get mad at you . it works pretty much the same way with
mailing lists , with the difference that you are calling hundreds or
thousands of people at the same time , and consequently you can expect a
lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list
address .
you may leave the list at any time by sending a "" signoff frbnyrmagl ""
command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can also tell listserv how
you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list . if
you do not trust the system , send a "" set frbnyrmagl repro "" command and
listserv will send you a copy of your own messages , so that you can see
that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way .
after a while you may find that this is getting annoying , especially if
your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it
informs you that new mail has arrived from frbnyrmagl . if you send a "" set
frbnyrmagl ack norepro "" command , listserv will mail you a short
acknowledgement instead , which will look different in your mailbox
directory . with most mail programs you will know immediately that this is
an acknowledgement you can read later . finally , you can turn off
acknowledgements completely with "" set frbnyrmagl noack norepro "" .
contributions sent to this list are automatically archived . you can get a
list of the available archive files by sending an "" index frbnyrmagl ""
command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can then order these files
with a "" get frbnyrmagl logxxxx "" command , or using listserv ' s database
search facilities . send an "" info database "" command for more information
on the latter .
important : this list is confidential . you should not publicly mention its
existence , or forward copies of information you have obtained from it to
third parties . please note that the "" give "" command is automatically
disabled for all archive files .

"i ' m sorry , did we discuss bmc ? ? ? .
lee can confirm the accuracy of this , but bmc bought 20 , 000 from us and
intended no swing and no buyback . brandywine ( dorcheus ) controlled the meter ,
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders . i
believe a deal is in place with brandywine to cover that very issue for
november . if not please let me know .
lee , if this is not your understanding for nov . business please let us all
know .

lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my relatives (They had squandered the funds i gave them for this purpose before)are around me and my health status. I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others.Contact my lawyer with this email:

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

 Good Day
 
Pardon me for not having the pleasure of knowing your mindset before making this offer which I know must come to you by surprise and it is utterly confidential and genuine by virtue of its nature. It is the pressure of life that made me write you in this manner. Just know that this is a message from a man that sincerely needs an urgent assistance.
 
My name is Michael Kuffo. I am a banker and On this premise I wish to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer business involving US$ 5.850M(Five million eight hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars).This money was drawn and kept away, out of the excess and unprecedented profit made last year by my branch office where I am the manager. I invested it on the new found oil contract deal and in forex reserve trade where I used the bank access fund to execute secretly. I have already submitted an audited, approved and certified end-of-the-year report for the year 2012 to my head office in Accra-Ghana and they will never on earth find out such. Equally dividends has been declared and shared to the shareholders of the bank on 30th of December 2012 during the bankâ€™s Annual General Meeting.
 
The business where I invested this funds has just been matured and the capital and it's turnover profit/share I got from the investment of the funds as agreed between
 
me and the partner who frontier the business where invseted the fund is what I    want you to stand as the beneficiary because there is no way I can handle this without a capable hand who will stand and recieve the funds because as an employee of this bank, I can not own such amount without being questioned on how I got it.
 
I have since then, placed these funds on a Non-Investment Account without a beneficiary. Could you perhaps be able to receive these funds under due and legal process, I will fill in your name and configure it in our bank database as holder of this Non-Investment Account. I will then guide you on how to apply to my head office for the Account Closure/bank-to-bank remittance of the fund to your designated bank account in your country.
 
If you find this risk free business proposal worthy to carry on, then note it that you will retain 35% of the funds while 65% shall be for me, because there are practically no risks involved. It is a God's sent business to me to help me alleviate the sufferings and pains am passing through in life for quite an appreciable number of years now. This transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the laws of my country Ghana and yours. Your major role would be to provide an existing account or open an account with zero balance, where the fund will be transferred and you then stand as the original depositor of this fund in our bank.
 
I will need your full details, such as your full name and address, your age,sex, occupation, telephone, I need to configure them into the account database to make it
appear in your name as the account account holder who owns the account.
I will be waiting for your urgent reply

Date: 2002-09-23T09:27:30-05:00No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that â€œit's not that badâ€ and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. â€œHow do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?â€ is a goal-oriented question. â€œCreate a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feedâ€ (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.[1] http://www.peerfear.org/

Date: 2002-09-20T17:10:35-08:00Yesterday Viridiana came to my place and dragged me out to look at the sky. It 
was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from 
NASA...

"I have emailed you earlier without a response; I wonder why you have not responded to my email.

In my first email I mentioned about a late customer whose relatives I cannot get in touch with. It is unfortunate that we are unable to find the relatives to this customer.

I am Dr. Bright Bruce, a Staff of UBS Investment bank London; I have a confidential business proposal for you: This mail is written and intended to solicit your assistance as follows:

The Governing Body of my Bank has spent time and resources to try to find the HEIR to lay claims to the Fund but no one has come up.

Fortunately, you bear the same surname with this late customer who banked with us before he died; Therefore, under a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the HEIR so that this fund will not be Confiscated by the Bank and pushed into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.

I am compelled to do this because I would not want the bank to push this fund into the bank treasury as unclaimed inheritance. For the sake of Transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate contact for further clarification and explanation on this matter.

I will need you also to reconfirm your Full Name and Address, also contact telephone number to ascertain the fact that I am dealing with the right person.

Thank you very much for your anticipated acceptance while i expect your prompt response to this matter as the urgency demands.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

My name is Edger Hoover; I work with the HM Treasury United Kingdom UK,and I have seen that several times people has tried to divert your funds into their own personal accounts I mean those that you call your partners. Now I am writing to you in respect of the amount which I have been able to send to you through the United Nations Diplomat who has arrived in Africa, now I want you to know that the diplomat would deliver the funds which I have packaged as a diplomatic compensation to you and the amount in the consignment is $6,000.000.00 (Six Million US Dollars).

To this end, I did not disclose the contents to the diplomat that the box contains money but I told him that it is your compensation from the Financial Secretary and from our affiliate, I want you to know that these funds would help with your financial status as I have seen in records that you have spent a lot trying to receive these funds and I am not demanding so much from you but only 40% them.I would like you to get back to me so that I can give you the contact details of the diplomat who arrived in Africa two days ago and has been waiting to get your details so that he can proceed with the delivery on your doorstep.

Yours Sincerely,
Edger Hoover.",1,1,"[""London"", ""LE"", ""\u01208"", ""\u0120packaged"", ""IN"", ""\u0120EC"", ""\u010a\u010a"", ""atton"", ""\u0120H"", ""\u0120Garden""]","[0.00014872569005573957, 3.125145104725409e-05, 3.124920364281027e-05, 2.8391213466723762e-05, 2.5669572610509072e-05, 2.5668108600354443e-05, 2.4073747964692595e-05, 2.071097839261261e-05, 2.0710744076138198e-05, 2.0710744076138198e-05]","[""name"", ""My"", ""Treasury"", ""Confidential"", ""8LE"", ""Edger"", ""Hatton"", ""demanding"", ""into"", ""waiting""]","[0.00020221766726533956, 0.00019875537006580434, 0.00019166619276297226, 0.0001711652588587859, 0.00015422514531798366, 7.887057120204762e-05, 7.272961123863006e-05, 3.463796913212296e-05, 2.0357635693392883e-06, 1.5283076568486566e-06]"

"louise ,
i think the following is appropriate and i can get done :
dyer :
base - same
cash - $ 50
equity - $ 150
mcdonald :
base - same
cash - $ 75
equity - $ 200
parquet :
base - same
cash - $ 100
equity - $ 250
i know these are at the top end . for what it is worth , the other guys i got done this year were not at the top end because i did not believe it was necessary ( gilbert , page , etringer , thome , wehn ) .
if we can say done , the actual contract process can be slowed so that the equity is not set till the november meeting . also , if we get done , i wont bug you anymore !

"climate prediction center winter outlook
?
? ? ? the climate prediction center , a unit of the national oceanic and
atmospheric administration , discusses the outlook for this winter . the
agency does not expect el nino and la nina to affect global weather for the
next nine months . the two weather patterns , which occur because of changes
in ocean temperatures in the pacific ocean , directly influence us rain
patterns and land temperatures . the cpc says this winter will be the first
year in three that the us has not had a strong influence from this
particular climate - driving force . but , that does not mean there will be a
whole lot of difference in terms of when winter will start . it will have
something to do with temperatures , because both la nina and el nino have
tended to make temperatures moderate in the winter . ? the cpc expects that
this winter nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal ,
but not as warm as the last three . the northern part of the nation and
particularly the northeast , however , could be an exception with colder
weather . the warmer pattern will be confined more to the west and the south .
east of the mississippi with the exception of florida should be cooler this
winter and most of california and the northern half of the rockies and the
dakotas . for the fall and winter , expect the southwest to be the mild and

"DEAR ESTEEM CUSTOMER

        I AM MR. B A JOHNSON A COMPUTER SCIENTIST. I JUST STARTED WORK WITH CITI FINANCE BANK. OUT OF EXCITEMENT ON MY NEW EMPLOYMENT, AND THE URGE FOR FAST PROMOTION IN THE OFFICE, I WAS GOING THROUGH THE BANK INFORMATION VIA MY SYSTEM AND IN THE PROCESS, I DISCOVERED YOUR INFORMATION  ON THE LISTS OF UNCLAIMED OVERDUE CONTRACT/INHERITANCE FUNDS OWED BY THE RESIGNED MEMBERS OF THIS BANK IN THE PAST YEARS. 

YOUR FILE WAS MARKED X AND YOUR RELEASED DISK  PAINTED RED, I TOOK TIME TO STUDY IT AND FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVE PAID VIRTUALLY ALL FEES AND CERTIFICATES BUT THE FUND HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED TO YOU.

      THE MOST ANNOYING THING IS THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH THAT ON NO ACCOUNT WILL THEY EVER RELEASE THE FUND TO YOU. THIS IS LIKE A MAFIA SETTING TO ACHIEVE THEIR SELFISH REASONS; YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A BANKER.  I CAN NEVER BE A PART OF EVIL BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE. THE ONLY THING I WILL NEED TO RELEASE THIS FUND IS A SPECIAL HARD DISK WE CALL IT HD190 GIG. 

TWO OF THIS HARD DISKS WOULD BE PURCHASED, I SHALL RECOPY YOUR INFORMATION, DESTROY THE PREVIOUS ONE AND PUNCH THE COMPUTER TO REFLECT IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WITHIN 24 BANKING HOURS. AFTER WHICH I WILL CLEAN UP THE TRACER AND DESTROY YOUR FILE. I DO NOT NEED GRATIFICATION FROM YOU EITHER IN CASH OR KIND. 

PLEASE DO NOT EXPOSE MY PERSON AS IT IS NOT EASY TO GET JOBS AROUND HERE AND I CANNOT CONTEND WITH THESE POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY CAN ELIMINATE ME JUST LIKE THAT.

 YOU CAN E-MAIL ME FOR MORE DETAILS.
    ANTICIPATING YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE.
